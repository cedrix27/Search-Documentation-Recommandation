Snakemaker: Seamlessly transforming ad-hoc analyses into sustainable Snakemake workflows with generative AI,"Reproducibility and sustainability present significant challenges in bioinformatics software development, where rapidly evolving tools and complex workflows often result in short-lived or difficult-to-adapt pipelines. This paper introduces Snakemaker, a tool that leverages generative AI to facilitate researchers build sustainable data analysis pipelines by converting unstructured code into well-defined Snakemake workflows. Snakemaker non-invasively tracks the work performed in the terminal by the researcher, analyzes execution patterns, and generates Snakemake workflows that can be integrated into existing pipelines. Snakemaker also supports the transformation of monolithic Ipython Notebooks into modular Snakemake pipelines, resolving the global state of the notebook into discrete, file-based interactions between rules. An integrated chat assistant provides users with fine-grained control through natural language instructions. Snakemaker generates high-quality Snakemake workflows by adhering to the best practices, including Conda environment tracking, generic rule generation and loop unrolling. By lowering the barrier between prototype and production-quality code, Snakemaker addresses a critical gap in computational reproducibility for bioinformatics research.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02841.pdf,"Marco Masera, Alessandro Leone, Johannes K\""oster, Ivan Molineris",cs.SE
Feature Staleness Aware Incremental Learning for CTR Prediction,"Click-through Rate (CTR) prediction in real-world recommender systems often deals with billions of user interactions every day. To improve the training efficiency, it is common to update the CTR prediction model incrementally using the new incremental data and a subset of historical data. However, the feature embeddings of a CTR prediction model often get stale when the corresponding features do not appear in current incremental data. In the next period, the model would have a performance degradation on samples containing stale features, which we call the feature staleness problem. To mitigate this problem, we propose a Feature Staleness Aware Incremental Learning method for CTR prediction (FeSAIL) which adaptively replays samples containing stale features. We first introduce a staleness aware sampling algorithm (SAS) to sample a fixed number of stale samples with high sampling efficiency. We then introduce a staleness aware regularization mechanism (SAR) for a fine-grained control of the feature embedding updating. We instantiate FeSAIL with a general deep learning-based CTR prediction model and the experimental results demonstrate FeSAIL outperforms various state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02844.pdf,"Zhikai Wang, Yanyan Shen, Zibin Zhang, Kangyi Lin",cs.IR
The Precautionary Principle and the Innovation Principle: Incompatible Guides for AI Innovation Governance?,"In policy debates concerning the governance and regulation of Artificial Intelligence (AI), both the Precautionary Principle (PP) and the Innovation Principle (IP) are advocated by their respective interest groups. Do these principles offer wholly incompatible and contradictory guidance? Does one necessarily negate the other? I argue here that provided attention is restricted to weak-form PP and IP, the answer to both of these questions is ""No."" The essence of these weak formulations is the requirement to fully account for type-I error costs arising from erroneously preventing the innovation's diffusion through society (i.e. mistaken regulatory red-lighting) as well as the type-II error costs arising from erroneously allowing the innovation to diffuse through society (i.e. mistaken regulatory green-lighting). Within the Signal Detection Theory (SDT) model developed here, weak-PP red-light (weak-IP green-light) determinations are optimal for sufficiently small (large) ratios of expected type-I to type-II error costs. For intermediate expected cost ratios, an amber-light 'wait-and-monitor' policy is optimal. Regulatory sandbox instruments allow AI testing and experimentation to take place within a structured environment of limited duration and societal scale, whereby the expected cost ratio falls within the 'wait-and-monitor' range. Through sandboxing regulators and innovating firms learn more about the expected cost ratio, and what respective adaptations -- of regulation, of technical solution, of business model, or combination thereof, if any -- are needed to keep the ratio out of the weak-PP red-light zone.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02846.pdf,Kim Kaivanto,cs.CY
Sentient Agent as a Judge: Evaluating Higher-Order Social Cognition in Large Language Models,"Assessing how well a large language model (LLM) understands human, rather than merely text, remains an open challenge. To bridge the gap, we introduce Sentient Agent as a Judge (SAGE), an automated evaluation framework that measures an LLM's higher-order social cognition. SAGE instantiates a Sentient Agent that simulates human-like emotional changes and inner thoughts during interaction, providing a more realistic evaluation of the tested model in multi-turn conversations. At every turn, the agent reasons about (i) how its emotion changes, (ii) how it feels, and (iii) how it should reply, yielding a numerical emotion trajectory and interpretable inner thoughts. Experiments on 100 supportive-dialogue scenarios show that the final Sentient emotion score correlates strongly with Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI) ratings and utterance-level empathy metrics, validating psychological fidelity. We also build a public Sentient Leaderboard covering 18 commercial and open-source models that uncovers substantial gaps (up to 4x) between frontier systems (GPT-4o-Latest, Gemini2.5-Pro) and earlier baselines, gaps not reflected in conventional leaderboards (e.g., Arena). SAGE thus provides a principled, scalable and interpretable tool for tracking progress toward genuinely empathetic and socially adept language agents.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02847.pdf,"Bang Zhang, Ruotian Ma, Qingxuan Jiang, Peisong Wang, Jiaqi Chen, Zheng Xie, Xingyu Chen, Yue Wang, Fanghua Ye, Jian Li, Yifan Yang, Zhaopeng Tu, Xiaolong Li",cs.CL
Aligning Large Language Models with Healthcare Stakeholders: A Pathway to Trustworthy AI Integration,"The wide exploration of large language models (LLMs) raises the awareness of alignment between healthcare stakeholder preferences and model outputs. This alignment becomes a crucial foundation to empower the healthcare workflow effectively, safely, and responsibly. Yet the varying behaviors of LLMs may not always match with healthcare stakeholders' knowledge, demands, and values. To enable a human-AI alignment, healthcare stakeholders will need to perform essential roles in guiding and enhancing the performance of LLMs. Human professionals must participate in the entire life cycle of adopting LLM in healthcare, including training data curation, model training, and inference. In this review, we discuss the approaches, tools, and applications of alignments between healthcare stakeholders and LLMs. We demonstrate that LLMs can better follow human values by properly enhancing healthcare knowledge integration, task understanding, and human guidance. We provide outlooks on enhancing the alignment between humans and LLMs to build trustworthy real-world healthcare applications.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02848.pdf,"Kexin Ding, Mu Zhou, Akshay Chaudhari, Shaoting Zhang, Dimitris N.

Enhancing tutoring systems by leveraging tailored promptings and domain knowledge with Large Language Models,"Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have reignited interest in their impact on Computer-based Learning (CBL). AI-driven tools like ChatGPT and Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) have enhanced learning experiences through personalisation and flexibility. ITSs can adapt to individual learning needs and provide customised feedback based on a student's performance, cognitive state, and learning path. Despite these advances, challenges remain in accommodating diverse learning styles and delivering real-time, context-aware feedback. Our research aims to address these gaps by integrating skill-aligned feedback via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) into prompt engineering for Large Language Models (LLMs) and developing an application to enhance learning through personalised tutoring in a computer science programming context. The pilot study evaluated a proposed system using three quantitative metrics: readability score, response time, and feedback depth, across three programming tasks of varying complexity. The system successfully sorted simulated students into three skill-level categories and provided context-aware feedback. This targeted approach demonstrated better effectiveness and adaptability compared to general methods.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02849.pdf,"Mohsen Balavar, Wenli Yang, David Herbert, Soonja Yeom",cs.CY
Harnessing Structured Knowledge: A Concept Map-Based Approach for High-Quality Multiple Choice Question Generation with Effective Distractors,"Generating high-quality MCQs, especially those targeting diverse cognitive levels and incorporating common misconceptions into distractor design, is time-consuming and expertise-intensive, making manual creation impractical at scale. Current automated approaches typically generate questions at lower cognitive levels and fail to incorporate domain-specific misconceptions. This paper presents a hierarchical concept map-based framework that provides structured knowledge to guide LLMs in generating MCQs with distractors. We chose high-school physics as our test domain and began by developing a hierarchical concept map covering major Physics topics and their interconnections with an efficient database design. Next, through an automated pipeline, topic-relevant sections of these concept maps are retrieved to serve as a structured context for the LLM to generate questions and distractors that specifically target common misconceptions. Lastly, an automated validation is completed to ensure that the generated MCQs meet the requirements provided. We evaluate our framework against two baseline approaches: a base LLM and a RAG-based generation. We conducted expert evaluations and student assessments of the generated MCQs. Expert evaluation shows that our method significantly outperforms the baseline approaches, achieving a success rate of 75.20% in meeting all quality criteria compared to approximately 37% for both baseline methods. Student assessment data reveal that our concept map-driven approach achieved a significantly lower guess success rate of 28.05% compared to 37.10% for the baselines, indicating a more effective assessment of conceptual understanding. The results demonstrate that our concept map-based approach enables robust assessment across cognitive levels and instant identification of conceptual gaps, facilitating faster feedback loops and targeted interventions at scale.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02850.pdf,"Nicy Scaria, Silvester John Joseph Kennedy, Diksha Seth, Ananya Thakur, Deepak Subramani",cs.CL
30DayGen: Leveraging LLMs to Create a Content Corpus for Habit Formation,"In this paper, we present 30 Day Me, a habit formation application that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to help users break down their goals into manageable, actionable steps and track their progress. Central to the app is the 30DAYGEN system, which generates 3,531 unique 30-day challenges sourced from over 15K webpages, and enables runtime search of challenge ideas aligned with user-defined goals. We showcase how LLMs can be harnessed to rapidly construct domain specific content corpora for behavioral and educational purposes, and propose a practical pipeline that incorporates effective LLM enhanced approaches for content generation and semantic deduplication.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02851.pdf,"Franklin Zhang, Sonya Zhang, Alon Halevy",cs.CL
A Computational Model of Inclusive Pedagogy: From Understanding to Application,"Human education transcends mere knowledge transfer, it relies on co-adaptation dynamics -- the mutual adjustment of teaching and learning strategies between agents. Despite its centrality, computational models of co-adaptive teacher-student interactions (T-SI) remain underdeveloped. We argue that this gap impedes Educational Science in testing and scaling contextual insights across diverse settings, and limits the potential of Machine Learning systems, which struggle to emulate and adaptively support human learning processes. To address this, we present a computational T-SI model that integrates contextual insights on human education into a testable framework. We use the model to evaluate diverse T-SI strategies in a realistic synthetic classroom setting, simulating student groups with unequal access to sensory information. Results show that strategies incorporating co-adaptation principles (e.g., bidirectional agency) outperform unilateral approaches (i.e., where only the teacher or the student is active), improving the learning outcomes for all learning types. Beyond the testing and scaling of context-dependent educational insights, our model enables hypothesis generation in controlled yet adaptable environments. This work bridges non-computational theories of human education with scalable, inclusive AI in Education systems, providing a foundation for equitable technologies that dynamically adapt to learner needs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02853.pdf,"Francesco Balzan, Pedro P.

Ensuring Reproducibility in Generative AI Systems for General Use Cases: A Framework for Regression Testing and Open Datasets,"Reproducibility and reliability remain pressing challenges for generative AI systems whose behavior can drift with each model update or prompt revision. We introduce GPR-bench, a lightweight, extensible benchmark that operationalizes regression testing for general purpose use cases. GPR-bench couples an open, bilingual (English and Japanese) dataset covering eight task categories (e.g., text generation, code generation, and information retrieval) and 10 scenarios in each task categories (80 total test cases for each language) with an automated evaluation pipeline that employs ""LLM-as-a-Judge"" scoring of correctness and conciseness. Experiments across three recent model versions - gpt-4o-mini, o3-mini, and o4-mini - and two prompt configurations (default versus concise-writing instruction) reveal heterogeneous quality. Our results show that newer models generally improve correctness, but the differences are modest and not statistically significant, suggesting that GPR-bench may not be sufficiently challenging to differentiate between recent model versions. In contrast, the concise-writing instruction significantly enhances conciseness (+12.37 pp, Mann-Whitney U test: p < 0.001, effect size r = 0.2995) with minimal degradations on accuracy (-1.7 pp), demonstrating the effectiveness of prompt engineering. Released under the MIT License, GPR- bench lowers the barrier to initiating reproducibility monitoring and provides a foundation for community-driven extensions, while also raising important considerations about benchmark design for rapidly evolving language models.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02854.pdf,"Masumi Morishige, Ryo Koshihara",cs.CL
AI Education in a Mirror: Challenges Faced by Academic and Industry Experts,"As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies continue to evolve, the gap between academic AI education and real-world industry challenges remains an important area of investigation. This study provides preliminary insights into challenges AI professionals encounter in both academia and industry, based on semi-structured interviews with 14 AI experts - eight from industry and six from academia. We identify key challenges related to data quality and availability, model scalability, practical constraints, user behavior, and explainability. While both groups experience data and model adaptation difficulties, industry professionals more frequently highlight deployment constraints, resource limitations, and external dependencies, whereas academics emphasize theoretical adaptation and standardization issues. These exploratory findings suggest that AI curricula could better integrate real-world complexities, software engineering principles, and interdisciplinary learning, while recognizing the broader educational goals of building foundational and ethical reasoning skills.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02856.pdf,"Mahir Akgun, Hadi Hosseini",cs.CY
Overcoming Obstacles: Challenges of Gender Inequality in Undergraduate ICT Programs,"Context: Gender inequality is a widely discussed issue across various sectors, including Information Technology and Communication (ICT). In Brazil, women represent less than 18% of ICT students in higher education. Prior studies highlight gender-related barriers that discourage women from staying in ICT. However, they provide limited insights into their perceptions as undergraduate students and the factors influencing their participation and confidence. Goal: This study explores the perceptions of women undergraduate students in ICT regarding gender inequality. Method: A survey of 402 women from 18 Brazilian states enrolled in ICT courses was conducted using a mixed-method approach, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results: Women students reported experiencing discriminatory practices from peers and professors, both inside and outside the classroom. Gender stereotypes were found to undermine their self-confidence and self-esteem, occasionally leading to course discontinuation. Conclusions: Factors such as lack of representation, inappropriate jokes, isolation, mistrust, and difficulty being heard contribute to harmful outcomes, including reduced participation and reluctance to take leadership roles. Addressing these issues is essential to creating a safe and respectful learning environment for all students.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02857.pdf,"Angelica Pereira Souza, Anderson Uch\^oa, Edna Dias Canedo, Juliana Alves Pereira, Claudia Pinto Pereira, Larissa Rocha",cs.CY
Towards High-Fidelity Synthetic Multi-platform Social Media Datasets via Large Language Models,"Social media datasets are essential for research on a variety of topics, such as disinformation, influence operations, hate speech detection, or influencer marketing practices. However, access to social media datasets is often constrained due to costs and platform restrictions. Acquiring datasets that span multiple platforms, which is crucial for understanding the digital ecosystem, is particularly challenging. This paper explores the potential of large language models to create lexically and semantically relevant social media datasets across multiple platforms, aiming to match the quality of real data. We propose multi-platform topic-based prompting and employ various language models to generate synthetic data from two real datasets, each consisting of posts from three different social media platforms. We assess the lexical and semantic properties of the synthetic data and compare them with those of the real data. Our empirical findings show that using large language models to generate synthetic multi-platform social media data is promising, different language models perform differently in terms of fidelity, and a post-processing approach might be needed for generating high-fidelity synthetic datasets for research. In addition to the empirical evaluation of three state of the art large language models, our contributions include new fidelity metrics specific to multi-platform social media datasets.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02858.pdf,"Henry Tari, Nojus Sereiva, Rishabh Kaushal, Thales Bertaglia, Adriana Iamnitchi",cs.CL
Enhancing ML Model Interpretability: Leveraging Fine-Tuned Large Language Models for Better Understanding of AI,"Across various sectors applications of eXplainableAI (XAI) gained momentum as the increasing black-boxedness of prevailing Machine Learning (ML) models became apparent. In parallel, Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly developed in their abilities to understand human language and complex patterns. By combining both, this paper presents a novel reference architecture for the interpretation of XAI through an interactive chatbot powered by a fine-tuned LLM. We instantiate the reference architecture in the context of State-of-Health (SoH) prediction for batteries and validate its design in multiple evaluation and demonstration rounds. The evaluation indicates that the implemented prototype enhances the human interpretability of ML, especially for users with less experience with XAI.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02859.pdf,"Jonas Bokstaller, Julia Altheimer, Julian Dormehl, Alina Buss, Jasper Wiltfang, Johannes Schneider, Maximilian R\""oglinger",cs.CL
Neural Orchestration for Multi-Agent Systems: A Deep Learning Framework for Optimal Agent Selection in Multi-Domain Task Environments,"Multi-agent systems (MAS) are foundational in simulating complex real-world scenarios involving autonomous, interacting entities. However, traditional MAS architectures often suffer from rigid coordination mechanisms and difficulty adapting to dynamic tasks. We propose MetaOrch, a neural orchestration framework for optimal agent selection in multi-domain task environments. Our system implements a supervised learning approach that models task context, agent histories, and expected response quality to select the most appropriate agent for each task. A novel fuzzy evaluation module scores agent responses along completeness, relevance, and confidence dimensions, generating soft supervision labels for training the orchestrator. Unlike previous methods that hard-code agent-task mappings, MetaOrch dynamically predicts the most suitable agent while estimating selection confidence. Experiments in simulated environments with heterogeneous agents demonstrate that our approach achieves 86.3% selection accuracy, significantly outperforming baseline strategies including random selection and round-robin scheduling. The modular architecture emphasizes extensibility, allowing agents to be registered, updated, and queried independently. Results suggest that neural orchestration offers a powerful approach to enhancing the autonomy, interpretability, and adaptability of multi-agent systems across diverse task domains.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02861.pdf,"Kushagra Agrawal, Nisharg Nargund",cs.MA
Cannot See the Forest for the Trees: Invoking Heuristics and Biases to Elicit Irrational Choices of LLMs,"Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can compromise their safety mechanisms. Existing studies often rely on brute-force optimization or manual design, failing to uncover potential risks in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel jailbreak attack framework, ICRT, inspired by heuristics and biases in human cognition. Leveraging the simplicity effect, we employ cognitive decomposition to reduce the complexity of malicious prompts. Simultaneously, relevance bias is utilized to reorganize prompts, enhancing semantic alignment and inducing harmful outputs effectively. Furthermore, we introduce a ranking-based harmfulness evaluation metric that surpasses the traditional binary success-or-failure paradigm by employing ranking aggregation methods such as Elo, HodgeRank, and Rank Centrality to comprehensively quantify the harmfulness of generated content. Experimental results show that our approach consistently bypasses mainstream LLMs' safety mechanisms and generates high-risk content, providing insights into jailbreak attack risks and contributing to stronger defense strategies.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02862.pdf,"Haoming Yang, Ke Ma, Xiaojun Jia, Yingfei Sun, Qianqian Xu, Qingming Huang",cs.CL
Understanding University Students' Use of Generative AI: The Roles of Demographics and Personality Traits,"The use of generative AI (GAI) among university students is rapidly increasing, yet empirical research on students' GAI use and the factors influencing it remains limited. To address this gap, we surveyed 363 undergraduate and graduate students in the United States, examining their GAI usage and how it relates to demographic variables and personality traits based on the Big Five model (i.e., extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability, and intellect/imagination). Our findings reveal: (a) Students in higher academic years are more inclined to use GAI and prefer it over traditional resources. (b) Non-native English speakers use and adopt GAI more readily than native speakers. (c) Compared to White, Asian students report higher GAI usage, perceive greater academic benefits, and express a stronger preference for it. Similarly, Black students report a more positive impact of GAI on their academic performance. Personality traits also play a significant role in shaping perceptions and usage of GAI. After controlling demographic factors, we found that personality still significantly predicts GAI use and attitudes: (a) Students with higher conscientiousness use GAI less. (b) Students who are higher in agreeableness perceive a less positive impact of GAI on academic performance and express more ethical concerns about using it for academic work. (c) Students with higher emotional stability report a more positive impact of GAI on learning and fewer concerns about its academic use. (d) Students with higher extraversion show a stronger preference for GAI over traditional resources. (e) Students with higher intellect/imagination tend to prefer traditional resources. These insights highlight the need for universities to provide personalized guidance to ensure students use GAI effectively, ethically, and equitably in their academic pursuits.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02863.pdf,"Newnew Deng, Edward Jiusi Liu, Xiaoming Zhai",cs.CY
Accelerating Large Language Model Reasoning via Speculative Search,"Tree-search-based reasoning methods have significantly enhanced the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by facilitating the exploration of multiple intermediate reasoning steps, i.e., thoughts. However, these methods suffer from substantial inference latency, as they have to generate numerous reasoning thoughts, severely limiting LLM applicability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Speculative Search (SpecSearch) framework that significantly accelerates LLM reasoning by optimizing thought generation. Specifically, SpecSearch utilizes a small model to strategically collaborate with a large model at both thought and token levels, efficiently generating high-quality reasoning thoughts. The major pillar of SpecSearch is a novel quality-preserving rejection mechanism, which effectively filters out thoughts whose quality falls below that of the large model's outputs. Moreover, we show that SpecSearch preserves comparable reasoning quality to the large model. Experiments on both the Qwen and Llama models demonstrate that SpecSearch significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 2.12$\times$ speedup with comparable reasoning quality.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02865.pdf,"Zhihai Wang, Jie Wang, Jilai Pan, Xilin Xia, Huiling Zhen, Mingxuan Yuan, Jianye Hao, Feng Wu",cs.CL
RESAnything: Attribute Prompting for Arbitrary Referring Segmentation,"We present an open-vocabulary and zero-shot method for arbitrary referring expression segmentation (RES), targeting input expressions that are more general than what prior works were designed to handle. Specifically, our inputs encompass both object- and part-level labels as well as implicit references pointing to properties or qualities of object/part function, design, style, material, etc. Our model, coined RESAnything, leverages Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) reasoning, where the key idea is attribute prompting. We generate detailed descriptions of object/part attributes including shape, color, and location for potential segment proposals through systematic prompting of a large language model (LLM), where the proposals are produced by a foundational image segmentation model. Our approach encourages deep reasoning about object or part attributes related to function, style, design, etc., enabling the system to handle implicit queries without any part annotations for training or fine-tuning. As the first zero-shot and LLM-based RES method, RESAnything achieves clearly superior performance among zero-shot methods on traditional RES benchmarks and significantly outperforms existing methods on challenging scenarios involving implicit queries and complex part-level relations. Finally, we contribute a new benchmark dataset to offer ~3K carefully curated RES instances to assess part-level, arbitrary RES solutions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02867.pdf,"Ruiqi Wang, Hao Zhang",cs.CV
Decoding Open-Ended Information Seeking Goals from Eye Movements in Reading,"When reading, we often have specific information that interests us in a text. For example, you might be reading this paper because you are curious about LLMs for eye movements in reading, the experimental design, or perhaps you only care about the question ``but does it work?''. More broadly, in daily life, people approach texts with any number of text-specific goals that guide their reading behavior. In this work, we ask, for the first time, whether open-ended reading goals can be automatically decoded from eye movements in reading. To address this question, we introduce goal classification and goal reconstruction tasks and evaluation frameworks, and use large-scale eye tracking for reading data in English with hundreds of text-specific information seeking tasks. We develop and compare several discriminative and generative multimodal LLMs that combine eye movements and text for goal classification and goal reconstruction. Our experiments show considerable success on both tasks, suggesting that LLMs can extract valuable information about the readers' text-specific goals from eye movements.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02872.pdf,"Cfir Avraham Hadar, Omer Shubi, Yoav Meiri, Yevgeni Berzak",cs.CL

Uncertainty Quantification for Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Survey,"Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is pivotal in enhancing the robustness, reliability, and interpretability of Machine Learning (ML) systems for healthcare, optimizing resources and improving patient care. Despite the emergence of ML-based clinical decision support tools, the lack of principled quantification of uncertainty in ML models remains a major challenge. Current reviews have a narrow focus on analyzing the state-of-the-art UQ in specific healthcare domains without systematically evaluating method efficacy across different stages of model development, and despite a growing body of research, its implementation in healthcare applications remains limited. Therefore, in this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of current UQ in healthcare, offering an informed framework that highlights how different methods can be integrated into each stage of the ML pipeline including data processing, training and evaluation. We also highlight the most popular methods used in healthcare and novel approaches from other domains that hold potential for future adoption in the medical context. We expect this study will provide a clear overview of the challenges and opportunities of implementing UQ in the ML pipeline for healthcare, guiding researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable techniques to enhance the reliability, safety and trust from patients and clinicians on ML-driven healthcare solutions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02874.pdf,"L.

Esc: An Early-stopping Checker for Budget-aware Index Tuning,"Index tuning is a time-consuming process. One major performance bottleneck in existing index tuning systems is the large amount of ""what-if"" query optimizer calls that estimate the cost of a given pair of query and index configuration without materializing the indexes. There has been recent work on budget-aware index tuning that limits the amount of what-if calls allowed in index tuning. Existing budget-aware index tuning algorithms, however, typically make fast progress early on in terms of the best configuration found but slow down when more and more what-if calls are allocated. This observation of ""diminishing return"" on index quality leads us to introduce early stopping for budget-aware index tuning, where user specifies a threshold on the tolerable loss of index quality and we stop index tuning if the projected loss with the remaining budget is below the threshold. We further propose Esc, a low-overhead early-stopping checker that realizes this new functionality. Experimental evaluation on top of both industrial benchmarks and real customer workloads demonstrate that Esc can significantly reduce the number of what-if calls made during budget-aware index tuning while incur little or zero improvement loss and little extra computational overhead compared to the overall index tuning time.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02876.pdf,"Xiaoying Wang, Wentao Wu, Vivek Narasayya, Surajit Chaudhuri",cs.DB
A Wireless Collaborated Inference Acceleration Framework for Plant Disease Recognition,"Plant disease is a critical factor affecting agricultural production. Traditional manual recognition methods face significant drawbacks, including low accuracy, high costs, and inefficiency. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated significant benefits in identifying plant diseases, but they still face challenges such as inference delays and high energy consumption. Deep learning algorithms are difficult to run on resource-limited embedded devices. Offloading these models to cloud servers is confronted with the restriction of communication bandwidth, and all of these factors will influence the inference's efficiency. We propose a collaborative inference framework for recognizing plant diseases between edge devices and cloud servers to enhance inference speed. The DNN model for plant disease recognition is pruned through deep reinforcement learning to improve the inference speed and reduce energy consumption. Then the optimal split point is determined by a greedy strategy to achieve the best collaborated inference acceleration. Finally, the system for collaborative inference acceleration in plant disease recognition has been implemented using Gradio to facilitate friendly human-machine interaction. Experiments indicate that the proposed collaborative inference framework significantly increases inference speed while maintaining acceptable recognition accuracy, offering a novel solution for rapidly diagnosing and preventing plant diseases.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02877.pdf,"Hele Zhu, Xinyi Huang, Haojia Gao, Mengfei Jiang, Haohua Que, Lei Mu",cs.LG
LLM4FTS: Enhancing Large Language Models for Financial Time Series Prediction,"Predicting financial time series presents significant challenges due to inherent low signal-to-noise ratios and intricate temporal patterns. Traditional machine learning models exhibit limitations in this forecasting task constrained by their restricted model capacity. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), with their greatly expanded parameter spaces, demonstrate promising potential for modeling complex dependencies in temporal sequences. However, existing LLM-based approaches typically focus on fixed-length patch analysis due to the Transformer architecture, ignoring market data's multi-scale pattern characteristics. In this study, we propose $LLM4FTS$, a novel framework that enhances LLM capabilities for temporal sequence modeling through learnable patch segmentation and dynamic wavelet convolution modules. Specifically,we first employ K-means++ clustering based on DTW distance to identify scale-invariant patterns in market data. Building upon pattern recognition results, we introduce adaptive patch segmentation that partitions temporal sequences while preserving maximal pattern integrity. To accommodate time-varying frequency characteristics, we devise a dynamic wavelet convolution module that emulates discrete wavelet transformation with enhanced flexibility in capturing time-frequency features. These three modules work together to improve large language model's ability to handle scale-invariant patterns in financial time series. Extensive experiments on real-world financial datasets substantiate the framework's efficacy, demonstrating superior performance in capturing complex market patterns and achieving state-of-the-art results in stock return prediction. The successful deployment in practical trading systems confirms its real-world applicability, representing a significant advancement in LLM applications for financial forecasting.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02880.pdf,"Zian Liu, Renjun Jia",cs.LG
Rewriting Pre-Training Data Boosts LLM Performance in Math and Code,"The performance of large language models (LLMs) in program synthesis and mathematical reasoning is fundamentally limited by the quality of their pre-training corpora. We introduce two openly licensed datasets, released under the Llama 3.3 Community License, that significantly enhance LLM performance by systematically rewriting public data. SwallowCode (approximately 16.1 billion tokens) refines Python snippets from The-Stack-v2 through a novel four-stage pipeline: syntax validation, pylint-based style filtering, and a two-stage LLM rewriting process that enforces style conformity and transforms snippets into self-contained, algorithmically efficient examples. Unlike prior methods that rely on exclusionary filtering or limited transformations, our transform-and-retain approach upgrades low-quality code, maximizing data utility. SwallowMath (approximately 2.3 billion tokens) enhances Finemath-4+ by removing boilerplate, restoring context, and reformatting solutions into concise, step-by-step explanations. Within a fixed 50 billion token training budget, continual pre-training of Llama-3.1-8B with SwallowCode boosts pass@1 by +17.0 on HumanEval and +17.7 on HumanEval+ compared to Stack-Edu, surpassing the baseline model's code generation capabilities. Similarly, substituting SwallowMath yields +12.4 accuracy on GSM8K and +7.6 on MATH.

SynQ: An Embedded DSL for Synchronous System Design with Quantitative Types,"System design automation aims to manage the design of embedded systems with ever-increasing complexity. To the success of system design automation, there is still a lack of systematic and formal design process because an entire design process, from a system's specification to its implementation, has to deal with inherent concerns about the systems' different aspects and, consequently, inherent semantic gaps. These gaps make it hard for a design process to be traceable or transparent. Particularly, guaranteeing the correctness of produced implementations becomes the main challenge for a system design process.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02883.pdf,"Rui Chen, Ingo Sander",cs.SE
Unlearning vs. Obfuscation: Are We Truly Removing Knowledge?,"Unlearning has emerged as a critical capability for large language models (LLMs) to support data privacy, regulatory compliance, and ethical AI deployment. Recent techniques often rely on obfuscation by injecting incorrect or irrelevant information to suppress knowledge. Such methods effectively constitute knowledge addition rather than true removal, often leaving models vulnerable to probing. In this paper, we formally distinguish unlearning from obfuscation and introduce a probing-based evaluation framework to assess whether existing approaches genuinely remove targeted information. Moreover, we propose DF-MCQ, a novel unlearning method that flattens the model predictive distribution over automatically generated multiple-choice questions using KL-divergence, effectively removing knowledge about target individuals and triggering appropriate refusal behaviour. Experimental results demonstrate that DF-MCQ achieves unlearning with over 90% refusal rate and a random choice-level uncertainty that is much higher than obfuscation on probing questions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02884.pdf,"Guangzhi Sun, Potsawee Manakul, Xiao Zhan, Mark Gales",cs.LG
When Your Own Output Becomes Your Training Data: Noise-to-Meaning Loops and a Formal RSI Trigger,"We present Noise-to-Meaning Recursive Self-Improvement (N2M-RSI), a minimal formal model showing that once an AI agent feeds its own outputs back as inputs and crosses an explicit information-integration threshold, its internal complexity will grow without bound under our assumptions. The framework unifies earlier ideas on self-prompting large language models, G\""odelian self-reference, and AutoML, yet remains implementation-agnostic. The model furthermore scales naturally to interacting swarms of agents, hinting at super-linear effects once communication among instances is permitted. For safety reasons, we omit system-specific implementation details and release only a brief, model-agnostic toy prototype in Appendix C.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02888.pdf,Rintaro Ando,cs.LG
Early Prediction of Sepsis: Feature-Aligned Transfer Learning,"Sepsis is a life threatening medical condition that occurs when the body has an extreme response to infection, leading to widespread inflammation, organ failure, and potentially death.

Our project aims to address this challenge by developing a machine learning based system to predict sepsis in its early stages, giving healthcare providers more time to intervene.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02889.pdf,"Oyindolapo O.

Zero-shot Sim2Real Transfer for Magnet-Based Tactile Sensor on Insertion Tasks,"Tactile sensing is an important sensing modality for robot manipulation. Among different types of tactile sensors, magnet-based sensors, like u-skin, balance well between high durability and tactile density. However, the large sim-to-real gap of tactile sensors prevents robots from acquiring useful tactile-based manipulation skills from simulation data, a recipe that has been successful for achieving complex and sophisticated control policies. Prior work has implemented binarization techniques to bridge the sim-to-real gap for dexterous in-hand manipulation. However, binarization inherently loses much information that is useful in many other tasks, e.g., insertion. In our work, we propose GCS, a novel sim-to-real technique to learn contact-rich skills with dense, distributed, 3-axis tactile readings. We evaluate our approach on blind insertion tasks and show zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of RL policies with raw tactile reading as input.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02915.pdf,"Beining Han, Abhishek Joshi, Jia Deng",cs.RO
RetroInfer: A Vector-Storage Approach for Scalable Long-Context LLM Inference,"The growing context lengths of large language models (LLMs) pose significant challenges for efficient inference, primarily due to GPU memory and bandwidth constraints. We present RetroInfer, a novel system that reconceptualizes the key-value (KV) cache as a vector storage system which exploits the inherent attention sparsity to accelerate long-context LLM inference. At its core is the wave index, an Attention-aWare VEctor index that enables efficient and accurate retrieval of critical tokens through techniques such as tripartite attention approximation, accuracy-bounded attention estimation, and segmented clustering. Complementing this is the wave buffer, which coordinates KV cache placement and overlaps computation and data transfer across GPU and CPU to sustain high throughput. Unlike prior sparsity-based methods that struggle with token selection and hardware coordination, RetroInfer delivers robust performance without compromising model accuracy. Experiments on long-context benchmarks show up to 4.5X speedup over full attention within GPU memory limits and up to 10.5X over sparse attention baselines when KV cache is extended to CPU memory, all while preserving full-attention-level accuracy.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02922.pdf,"Yaoqi Chen, Jinkai Zhang, Baotong Lu, Qianxi Zhang, Chengruidong Zhang, Jingjia Luo, Di Liu, Huiqiang Jiang, Qi Chen, Jing Liu, Bailu Ding, Xiao Yan, Jiawei Jiang, Chen Chen, Mingxing Zhang, Yuqing Yang, Fan Yang, Mao Yang",cs.LG
The Art of Repair: Optimizing Iterative Program Repair with Instruction-Tuned Models,"Automatic program repair (APR) aims to reduce the manual efforts required to identify and fix errors in source code. Before the rise of LLM-based agents, a common strategy was to increase the number of generated patches, sometimes to the thousands, to achieve better repair results on benchmarks. More recently, self-iterative capabilities enabled LLMs to refine patches over multiple rounds guided by feedback. However, literature often focuses on many iterations and disregards different numbers of outputs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02931.pdf,"Fernando Vallecillos Ruiz, Max Hort, Leon Moonen",cs.SE
Urban Forms Across Continents: A Data-Driven Comparison of Lausanne and Philadelphia,"Understanding urban form is crucial for sustainable urban planning and enhancing quality of life. This study presents a data-driven framework to systematically identify and compare urban typologies across geographically and culturally distinct cities. Using open-source geospatial data from OpenStreetMap, we extracted multidimensional features related to topography, multimodality, green spaces, and points of interest for the cities of Lausanne, Switzerland, and Philadelphia, USA. A grid-based approach was used to divide each city into Basic Spatial Units (BSU), and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) were applied to cluster BSUs based on their urban characteristics. The results reveal coherent and interpretable urban typologies within each city, with some cluster types emerging across both cities despite their differences in scale, density, and cultural context. Comparative analysis showed that adapting the grid size to each city's morphology improves the detection of shared typologies. Simplified clustering based solely on network degree centrality further demonstrated that meaningful structural patterns can be captured even with minimal feature sets. Our findings suggest the presence of functionally convergent urban forms across continents and highlight the importance of spatial scale in cross-city comparisons. The framework offers a scalable and transferable approach for urban analysis, providing valuable insights for planners and policymakers aiming to enhance walkability, accessibility, and well-being. Limitations related to data completeness and feature selection are discussed, and directions for future work -- including the integration of additional data sources and human-centered validation -- are proposed.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02938.pdf,"Arthur Carm\`es, L\'eo Catteau, Andrew Sonta, Arash Tavakoli",cs.CY
The Cognitive Foundations of Economic Exchange: A Modular Framework Grounded in Behavioral Evidence,"A key challenge in multi-agent AI is modeling social cooperation under realistic behavioral constraints. Many foundational concepts in economics and ethics such as ""trust"" or ""morality"" are often defined informally, without operational criteria or cognitive grounding, which limits their testability and implementation in artificial agents. Drawing on converging empirical evidence from primate behavior, infant cognition, and economic anthropology, we propose a conceptual framework composed of three cognitively minimal mechanisms: individual recognition, reciprocal credence, and cost return sensitivity. This framework reframes trust as a graded cognitive expectation, providing a simulateable basis for reciprocal exchange in artificial agents, and enabling the bottom-up emergence of scalable cooperation and institutional dynamics.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02945.pdf,Egil Diau,cs.CY
A variational multiscale approach to goal-oriented error estimation in finite element analysis of convection-diffusion-reaction equation problems,"This paper presents a goal-oriented a posteriori error estimation framework for linear functionals in the stabilized finite element discretization of the stationary convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) equation. The theoretical framework for error estimation is based on the variational multiscale (VMS) concept, where the solution is decomposed into resolved (finite element) and unresolved (sub-grid) scales. In this work, we propose an orthogonal sub-grid scale (OSGS) method for a goal-oriented error estimation in VMS discretizations. In the OSGS approach, the space of the sub-grid scales (SGSs) is orthogonal to the finite element space. The error is estimated in the quantity of interest, given by the linear functional $Q(u)$ of the unknown $u$. If the SGS $u'$ is estimated, the error in the quantity of interest can be approximated by $Q(u')$. Our approach is compared with a duality-based a posteriori error estimation method, which requires the solution of an additional auxiliary problem. The results indicate that both methods yield similar error estimates, whereas the VMS-based explicit approach is computationally less expensive than the duality-based implicit approach. Numerical tests demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed error estimation techniques in terms of the quantity of interest functionals.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02946.pdf,"Sheraz Ahmed Khan, Ramon Codina, Hauke Gravenkamp",math.NA
Gone With the Bits: Revealing Racial Bias in Low-Rate Neural Compression for Facial Images,"Neural compression methods are gaining popularity due to their superior rate-distortion performance over traditional methods, even at extremely low bitrates below 0.1 bpp. As deep learning architectures, these models are prone to bias during the training process, potentially leading to unfair outcomes for individuals in different groups. In this paper, we present a general, structured, scalable framework for evaluating bias in neural image compression models. Using this framework, we investigate racial bias in neural compression algorithms by analyzing nine popular models and their variants. Through this investigation, we first demonstrate that traditional distortion metrics are ineffective in capturing bias in neural compression models. Next, we highlight that racial bias is present in all neural compression models and can be captured by examining facial phenotype degradation in image reconstructions. We then examine the relationship between bias and realism in the decoded images and demonstrate a trade-off across models. Finally, we show that utilizing a racially balanced training set can reduce bias but is not a sufficient bias mitigation strategy. We additionally show the bias can be attributed to compression model bias and classification model bias. We believe that this work is a first step towards evaluating and eliminating bias in neural image compression models.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02949.pdf,"Tian Qiu, Arjun Nichani, Rasta Tadayontahmasebi, Haewon Jeong",cs.CV
Multi-Antenna Users in Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Stream Allocation and Necessity of Downlink Pilots,"We consider a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with multiple antennas on the users and access points (APs). In previous works, the downlink spectral efficiency (SE) has been evaluated using the hardening bound that requires no downlink pilots. This approach works well for single-antenna users. In this paper, we show that much higher SEs can be achieved if downlink pilots are sent when having multi-antenna users. The reason is that the effective channel matrix does not harden. We propose a pilot-based downlink estimation scheme, derive a new SE expression, and show numerically that it yields substantially higher performance when having correlated Rayleigh fading channels.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02951.pdf,"Eren Berk Kama, Junbeom Kim, Emil Bj\""ornson",cs.IT
Iterative Resolution of Prompt Ambiguities Using a Progressive Cutting-Search Approach,"Generative AI systems have revolutionized human interaction by enabling natural language-based coding and problem solving. However, the inherent ambiguity of natural language often leads to imprecise instructions, forcing users to iteratively test, correct, and resubmit their prompts. We propose an iterative approach that systematically narrows down these ambiguities through a structured series of clarification questions and alternative solution proposals, illustrated with input/output examples as well. Once every uncertainty is resolved, a final, precise solution is generated. Evaluated on a diverse dataset spanning coding, data analysis, and creative writing, our method demonstrates superior accuracy, competitive resolution times, and higher user satisfaction compared to conventional one-shot solutions, which typically require multiple manual iterations to achieve a correct output.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02952.pdf,Fabrizio Marozzo,cs.AI
Smooth Quadratic Prediction Markets,"When agents trade in a Duality-based Cost Function prediction market, they collectively implement the learning algorithm Follow-The-Regularized-Leader. We ask whether other learning algorithms could be used to inspire the design of prediction markets. By decomposing and modifying the Duality-based Cost Function Market Maker's (DCFMM) pricing mechanism, we propose a new prediction market, called the Smooth Quadratic Prediction Market, the incentivizes agents to collectively implement general steepest gradient descent. Relative to the DCFMM, the Smooth Quadratic Prediction Market has a better worst-case monetary loss for AD securities while preserving axiom guarantees such as the existence of instantaneous price, information incorporation, expressiveness, no arbitrage, and a form of incentive compatibility. To motivate the application of the Smooth Quadratic Prediction Market, we independently examine agents' trading behavior under two realistic constraints: bounded budgets and buy-only securities. Finally, we provide an introductory analysis of an approach to facilitate adaptive liquidity using the Smooth Quadratic AD Prediction Market. Our results suggest future designs where the price update rule is separate from the fee structure, yet guarantees are preserved.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02959.pdf,"Enrique Nueve, Bo Waggoner",cs.LG
Can We Recycle Our Old Models? An Empirical Evaluation of Model Selection Mechanisms for AIOps Solutions,"AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) solutions leverage the tremendous amount of data produced during the operation of large-scale systems and machine learning models to assist software practitioners in their system operations. Existing AIOps solutions usually maintain AIOps models against concept drift through periodical retraining, despite leaving a pile of discarded historical models that may perform well on specific future data. Other prior works propose dynamically selecting models for prediction tasks from a set of candidate models to optimize the model performance. However, there is no prior work in the AIOps area that assesses the use of model selection mechanisms on historical models to improve model performance or robustness. To fill the gap, we evaluate several model selection mechanisms by assessing their capabilities in selecting the optimal AIOps models that were built in the past to make predictions for the target data. We performed a case study on three large-scale public operation datasets: two trace datasets from the cloud computing platforms of Google and Alibaba, and one disk stats dataset from the BackBlaze cloud storage data center. We observe that the model selection mechnisms utilizing temporal adjacency tend to have a better performance and can prevail the periodical retraining approach. Our findings also highlight a performance gap between existing model selection mechnisms and the theoretical upper bound which may motivate future researchers and practitioners in investigating more efficient and effective model selection mechanisms that fit in the context of AIOps.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02961.pdf,"Yingzhe Lyu, Hao Li, Heng Li, Ahmed E.

In these environments, autoscalers may create an inefficient resource allocation. This work analyzes nine representative HPC applications with different memory consumption patterns. Our results identify the limitations and inefficiencies of the Kubernetes Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) for enabling memory elastic execution of HPC applications. We propose, implement, and evaluate ARC-V. This policy leverages both in-flight resource updates of pods in Kubernetes and the knowledge of memory consumption patterns of HPC applications for achieving elastic memory resource provisioning at the node level.

Generating Narrated Lecture Videos from Slides with Synchronized Highlights,"Turning static slides into engaging video lectures takes considerable time and effort, requiring presenters to record explanations and visually guide their audience through the material. We introduce an end-to-end system designed to automate this process entirely. Given a slide deck, this system synthesizes a video lecture featuring AI-generated narration synchronized precisely with dynamic visual highlights. These highlights automatically draw attention to the specific concept being discussed, much like an effective presenter would. The core technical contribution is a novel highlight alignment module. This module accurately maps spoken phrases to locations on a given slide using diverse strategies (e.g., Levenshtein distance, LLM-based semantic analysis) at selectable granularities (line or word level) and utilizes timestamp-providing Text-to-Speech (TTS) for timing synchronization. We demonstrate the system's effectiveness through a technical evaluation using a manually annotated slide dataset with 1000 samples, finding that LLM-based alignment achieves high location accuracy (F1 > 92%), significantly outperforming simpler methods, especially on complex, math-heavy content. Furthermore, the calculated generation cost averages under $1 per hour of video, offering potential savings of two orders of magnitude compared to conservative estimates of manual production costs. This combination of high accuracy and extremely low cost positions this approach as a practical and scalable tool for transforming static slides into effective, visually-guided video lectures.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02966.pdf,Alexander Holmberg,cs.CV

Physics-Learning AI Datamodel (PLAID) datasets: a collection of physics simulations for machine learning,"Machine learning-based surrogate models have emerged as a powerful tool to accelerate simulation-driven scientific workflows. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by the lack of large-scale, diverse, and standardized datasets tailored to physics-based simulations. While existing initiatives provide valuable contributions, many are limited in scope-focusing on specific physics domains, relying on fragmented tooling, or adhering to overly simplistic datamodels that restrict generalization. To address these limitations, we introduce PLAID (Physics-Learning AI Datamodel), a flexible and extensible framework for representing and sharing datasets of physics simulations. PLAID defines a unified standard for describing simulation data and is accompanied by a library for creating, reading, and manipulating complex datasets across a wide range of physical use cases (gitlab.com/drti/plaid). We release six carefully crafted datasets under the PLAID standard, covering structural mechanics and computational fluid dynamics, and provide baseline benchmarks using representative learning methods.

Navigating Privacy and Trust: AI Assistants as Social Support for Older Adults,"AI assistants are increasingly integrated into older adults' daily lives, offering new opportunities for social support and accessibility while raising important questions about privacy, autonomy, and trust. As these systems become embedded in caregiving and social networks, older adults must navigate trade-offs between usability, data privacy, and personal agency across different interaction contexts. Although prior work has explored AI assistants' potential benefits, further research is needed to understand how perceived usefulness and risk shape adoption and engagement. This paper examines these dynamics and advocates for participatory design approaches that position older adults as active decision makers in shaping AI assistant functionality.

Parallel GPU-Accelerated Randomized Construction of Approximate Cholesky Preconditioners,"We introduce a parallel algorithm to construct a preconditioner for solving a large, sparse linear system where the coefficient matrix is a Laplacian matrix (a.k.a., graph Laplacian). Such a linear system arises from applications such as discretization of a partial differential equation, spectral graph partitioning, and learning problems on graphs. The preconditioner belongs to the family of incomplete factorizations and is purely algebraic. Unlike traditional incomplete factorizations, the new method employs randomization to determine whether or not to keep fill-ins, i.e., newly generated nonzero elements during Gaussian elimination. Since the sparsity pattern of the randomized factorization is unknown, computing such a factorization in parallel is extremely challenging, especially on many-core architectures such as GPUs. Our parallel algorithm dynamically computes the dependency among row/column indices of the Laplacian matrix to be factorized and processes the independent indices in parallel. Furthermore, unlike previous approaches, our method requires little pre-processing time. We implemented the parallel algorithm for multi-core CPUs and GPUs, and we compare their performance to other state-of-the-art methods.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02977.pdf,"Tianyu Liang, Chao Chen, Yotam Yaniv, Hengrui Luo, David Tench, Xiaoye S.

The approach accounts for (bounded) uncertainties in network parameters and PMU measurements, enabling precise estimation of inertia and damping constants, as well as mechanical power inputs. Instead of assuming constant mechanical power input throughout, the approach leverages knowledge of power system operations to determine intervals when it is actually constant to maintain estimation consistency.

Completing Spatial Transcriptomics Data for Gene Expression Prediction Benchmarking,"Spatial Transcriptomics is a groundbreaking technology that integrates histology images with spatially resolved gene expression profiles. Among the various Spatial Transcriptomics techniques available, Visium has emerged as the most widely adopted. However, its accessibility is limited by high costs, the need for specialized expertise, and slow clinical integration. Additionally, gene capture inefficiencies lead to significant dropout, corrupting acquired data. To address these challenges, the deep learning community has explored the gene expression prediction task directly from histology images. Yet, inconsistencies in datasets, preprocessing, and training protocols hinder fair comparisons between models. To bridge this gap, we introduce SpaRED, a systematically curated database comprising 26 public datasets, providing a standardized resource for model evaluation. We further propose SpaCKLE, a state-of-the-art transformer-based gene expression completion model that reduces mean squared error by over 82.5% compared to existing approaches. Finally, we establish the SpaRED benchmark, evaluating eight state-of-the-art prediction models on both raw and SpaCKLE-completed data, demonstrating SpaCKLE substantially improves the results across all the gene expression prediction models.

More Optimal Fractional-Order Stochastic Gradient Descent for Non-Convex Optimization Problems,"Fractional-order stochastic gradient descent (FOSGD) leverages fractional exponents to capture long-memory effects in optimization. However, its utility is often limited by the difficulty of tuning and stabilizing these exponents. We propose 2SED Fractional-Order Stochastic Gradient Descent (2SEDFOSGD), which integrates the Two-Scale Effective Dimension (2SED) algorithm with FOSGD to adapt the fractional exponent in a data-driven manner. By tracking model sensitivity and effective dimensionality, 2SEDFOSGD dynamically modulates the exponent to mitigate oscillations and hasten convergence. Theoretically, for onoconvex optimization problems, this approach preserves the advantages of fractional memory without the sluggish or unstable behavior observed in na\""ive fractional SGD. Empirical evaluations in Gaussian and $\alpha$-stable noise scenarios using an autoregressive (AR) model highlight faster convergence and more robust parameter estimates compared to baseline methods, underscoring the potential of dimension-aware fractional techniques for advanced modeling and estimation tasks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02985.pdf,"Mohammad Partohaghighi, Roummel Marcia, YangQuan Chen",cs.LG
Including Bloom Filters in Bottom-up Optimization,"Bloom filters are used in query processing to perform early data reduction and improve query performance. The optimal query plan may be different when Bloom filters are used, indicating the need for Bloom filter-aware query optimization. To date, Bloom filter-aware query optimization has only been incorporated in a top-down query optimizer and limited to snowflake queries. In this paper, we show how Bloom filters can be incorporated in a bottom-up cost-based query optimizer. We highlight the challenges in limiting optimizer search space expansion, and offer an efficient solution. We show that including Bloom filters in cost-based optimization can lead to better join orders with effective predicate transfer between operators. On a 100 GB instance of the TPC-H database, our approach achieved a 32.8% further reduction in latency for queries involving Bloom filters, compared to the traditional approach of adding Bloom filters in a separate post-optimization step. Our method applies to all query types, and we provide several heuristics to balance limited increases in optimization time against improved query latency.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02994.pdf,"Tim Zeyl, Qi Cheng, Reza Pournaghi, Jason Lam, Weicheng Wang, Calvin Wong, Chong Chen, Per-Ake Larson",cs.DB
RADLADS: Rapid Attention Distillation to Linear Attention Decoders at Scale,"We present Rapid Attention Distillation to Linear Attention Decoders at Scale (RADLADS), a protocol for rapidly converting softmax attention transformers into linear attention decoder models, along with two new RWKV-variant architectures, and models converted from popular Qwen2.5 open source models in 7B, 32B, and 72B sizes.

Converting to our 72B linear attention model costs less than \$2,000 USD at today's prices, yet quality at inference remains close to the original transformer. These models achieve state-of-the-art downstream performance across a set of standard benchmarks for linear attention models of their size.

GIF: Generative Inspiration for Face Recognition at Scale,"Aiming to reduce the computational cost of Softmax in massive label space of Face Recognition (FR) benchmarks, recent studies estimate the output using a subset of identities. Although promising, the association between the computation cost and the number of identities in the dataset remains linear only with a reduced ratio. A shared characteristic among available FR methods is the employment of atomic scalar labels during training. Consequently, the input to label matching is through a dot product between the feature vector of the input and the Softmax centroids. Inspired by generative modeling, we present a simple yet effective method that substitutes scalar labels with structured identity code, i.e., a sequence of integers. Specifically, we propose a tokenization scheme that transforms atomic scalar labels into structured identity codes. Then, we train an FR backbone to predict the code for each input instead of its scalar label. As a result, the associated computational cost becomes logarithmic w.r.t. number of identities. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method by conducting experiments. In particular, our method outperforms its competitors by 1.52%, and 0.6% at TAR@FAR$=1e-4$ on IJB-B and IJB-C, respectively, while transforming the association between computational cost and the number of identities from linear to logarithmic.

Computing in Integrated Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks: A Comprehensive Survey,"The rapid growth of Internet-of-things (IoT) devices, smart vehicles, and other connected objects is driving demand for ubiquitous connectivity and intensive computing capacity. 5G and upcoming 6G networks are crucial to meeting these demands and the fast-evolving services and applications. However, traditional terrestrial networks face limitations in coverage and capacity. Integrated Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks (ITNTN) are emerging to address these challenges. In essence, ITNTN combines ground-based infrastructure with aerial, space, and water surface networks to provide seamless connectivity and computing resources anytime, anywhere. Given the stringent quality-of-service (QoS) of future services, edge computing will be an inseparable component of ITNTN. Consequently, we dive in this survey into current efforts of integrating cloud/fog/edge computing into ITNTN layers to facilitate stringent QoS services and address the data processing needs of modern applications. Since there have been only limited and partial efforts in integrating computing functionalities within ITNTN, we aim to extend the discussion to the full integration of computing and identifying the challenges and future research directions to achieve it.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03016.pdf,"Hoe Ziet Wong, Insaf Rzig, Safwan Alfattani, Wael Jaafar",cs.NI
Lesion-Aware Generative Artificial Intelligence for Virtual Contrast-Enhanced Mammography in Breast Cancer,"Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) is a dual-energy mammographic technique that improves lesion visibility through the administration of an iodinated contrast agent. It acquires both a low-energy image, comparable to standard mammography, and a high-energy image, which are then combined to produce a dual-energy subtracted image highlighting lesion contrast enhancement. While CESM offers superior diagnostic accuracy compared to standard mammography, its use entails higher radiation exposure and potential side effects associated with the contrast medium. To address these limitations, we propose Seg-CycleGAN, a generative deep learning framework for Virtual Contrast Enhancement in CESM. The model synthesizes high-fidelity dual-energy subtracted images from low-energy images, leveraging lesion segmentation maps to guide the generative process and improve lesion reconstruction. Building upon the standard CycleGAN architecture, Seg-CycleGAN introduces localized loss terms focused on lesion areas, enhancing the synthesis of diagnostically relevant regions. Experiments on the CESM@UCBM dataset demonstrate that Seg-CycleGAN outperforms the baseline in terms of PSNR and SSIM, while maintaining competitive MSE and VIF. Qualitative evaluations further confirm improved lesion fidelity in the generated images. These results suggest that segmentation-aware generative models offer a viable pathway toward contrast-free CESM alternatives.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03018.pdf,"Aurora Rofena, Arianna Manchia, Claudia Lucia Piccolo, Bruno Beomonte Zobel, Paolo Soda, Valerio Guarrasi",cs.CV
Memorization or Interpolation ? Detecting LLM Memorization through Input Perturbation Analysis,"While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance through training on massive datasets, they can exhibit concerning behaviors such as verbatim reproduction of training data rather than true generalization. This memorization phenomenon raises significant concerns about data privacy, intellectual property rights, and the reliability of model evaluations. This paper introduces PEARL, a novel approach for detecting memorization in LLMs. PEARL assesses how sensitive an LLM's performance is to input perturbations, enabling memorization detection without requiring access to the model's internals. We investigate how input perturbations affect the consistency of outputs, enabling us to distinguish between true generalization and memorization. Our findings, following extensive experiments on the Pythia open model, provide a robust framework for identifying when the model simply regurgitates learned information. Applied on the GPT 4o models, the PEARL framework not only identified cases of memorization of classic texts from the Bible or common code from HumanEval but also demonstrated that it can provide supporting evidence that some data, such as from the New York Times news articles, were likely part of the training data of a given model.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03019.pdf,"Alb\'erick Euraste Djir\'e, Abdoul Kader Kabor\'e, Earl T.

The Multimodal Paradox: How Added and Missing Modalities Shape Bias and Performance in Multimodal AI,"Multimodal learning, which integrates diverse data sources such as images, text, and structured data, has proven superior to unimodal counterparts in high-stakes decision-making. However, while performance gains remain the gold standard for evaluating multimodal systems, concerns around bias and robustness are frequently overlooked. In this context, this paper explores two key research questions (RQs): (i) RQ1 examines whether adding a modality con-sistently enhances performance and investigates its role in shaping fairness measures, assessing whether it mitigates or amplifies bias in multimodal models; (ii) RQ2 investigates the impact of missing modalities at inference time, analyzing how multimodal models generalize in terms of both performance and fairness. Our analysis reveals that incorporating new modalities during training consistently enhances the performance of multimodal models, while fairness trends exhibit variability across different evaluation measures and datasets. Additionally, the absence of modalities at inference degrades performance and fairness, raising concerns about its robustness in real-world deployment. We conduct extensive experiments using multimodal healthcare datasets containing images, time series, and structured information to validate our findings.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03020.pdf,"Kishore Sampath,  Pratheesh, Ayaazuddin Mohammad, Resmi Ramachandranpillai",cs.AI
A Typology of Synthetic Datasets for Dialogue Processing in Clinical Contexts,"Synthetic data sets are used across linguistic domains and NLP tasks, particularly in scenarios where authentic data is limited (or even non-existent). One such domain is that of clinical (healthcare) contexts, where there exist significant and long-standing challenges (e.g., privacy, anonymization, and data governance) which have led to the development of an increasing number of synthetic datasets. One increasingly important category of clinical dataset is that of clinical dialogues which are especially sensitive and difficult to collect, and as such are commonly synthesized.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03025.pdf,"Steven Bedrick, A.

Revisiting Performance Models of Distal Pointing Tasks in Virtual Reality,"Performance models of interaction, such as Fitts Law, are important tools for predicting and explaining human motor performance and for designing high-performance user interfaces. Extensive prior work has proposed such models for the 3D interaction task of distal pointing, in which the user points their hand or a device at a distant target in order to select it. However, there is no consensus on how to compute the index of difficulty for distal pointing tasks. We present a preliminary study suggesting that existing models may not be sufficient to model distal pointing performance with current virtual reality technologies. Based on these results, we hypothesized that both the form of the model and the standard method for collecting empirical data for pointing tasks might need to change in order to achieve a more accurate and valid distal pointing model. In our main study, we used a new methodology to collect distal pointing data and evaluated traditional models, purely ballistic models, and two-part models. Ultimately, we found that the best model used a simple Fitts-Law-style index of difficulty with angular measures of amplitude and width.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03027.pdf,"Logan Lane, Feiyu Lu, Shakiba Davari, Rob Teather, Doug A.

"UCSC at SemEval-2025 Task 3: Context, Models and Prompt Optimization for Automated Hallucination Detection in LLM Output","Hallucinations pose a significant challenge for large language models when answering knowledge-intensive queries. As LLMs become more widely adopted, it is crucial not only to detect if hallucinations occur but also to pinpoint exactly where in the LLM output they occur. SemEval 2025 Task 3, Mu-SHROOM: Multilingual Shared-task on Hallucinations and Related Observable Overgeneration Mistakes, is a recent effort in this direction. This paper describes the UCSC system submission to the shared Mu-SHROOM task. We introduce a framework that first retrieves relevant context, next identifies false content from the answer, and finally maps them back to spans in the LLM output. The process is further enhanced by automatically optimizing prompts. Our system achieves the highest overall performance, ranking #1 in average position across all languages. We release our code and experiment results.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03030.pdf,"Sicong Huang, Jincheng He, Shiyuan Huang, Karthik Raja Anandan, Arkajyoti Chakraborty, Ian Lane",cs.CL
Radio: Rate-Distortion Optimization for Large Language Model Compression,"In recent years, the compression of large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a key problem in facilitating LLM deployment on resource-limited devices, reducing compute costs, and mitigating the environmental footprint due to large-scale AI infrastructure. Here, we establish the foundations of LLM quantization from a rate-distortion theory perspective and propose a quantization technique based on simple rate-distortion optimization. Our technique scales to models containing hundreds of billions of weight parameters and offers users the flexibility to compress models, post-training, to a model size or accuracy specified by the user.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03031.pdf,Sean I.

"""Two-Stagification"": Job Dispatching in Large-Scale Clusters via a Two-Stage Architecture","A continuing effort is devoted to devising effective dispatching policies for clusters of First Come First Served servers. Although the optimal solution for dispatchers aware of both job size and server state remains elusive, lower bounds and strong heuristics are known. In this paper, we introduce a two-stage cluster architecture that applies classical Round Robin, Join Idle Queue, and Least Work Left dispatching schemes, coupled with an optimized service-time threshold to separate large jobs from shorter ones. Using both synthetic (Weibull) workloads and real Google data center traces, we demonstrate that our two-stage approach greatly improves upon the corresponding single-stage policies and closely approaches the performance of advanced size- and state-aware methods. Our results highlight that careful architectural design-rather than increased complexity at the dispatcher-can yield significantly better mean response times in large-scale computing environments.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03032.pdf,"Mert Yildiz, Alexey Rolich, Andrea Baiocchi",cs.DC
"Evaluating the Impact of AI-Powered Audiovisual Personalization on Learner Emotion, Focus, and Learning Outcomes","Independent learners often struggle with sustaining focus and emotional regulation in unstructured or distracting settings. Although some rely on ambient aids such as music, ASMR, or visual backgrounds to support concentration, these tools are rarely integrated into cohesive, learner-centered systems. Moreover, existing educational technologies focus primarily on content adaptation and feedback, overlooking the emotional and sensory context in which learning takes place. Large language models have demonstrated powerful multimodal capabilities including the ability to generate and adapt text, audio, and visual content. Educational research has yet to fully explore their potential in creating personalized audiovisual learning environments. To address this gap, we introduce an AI-powered system that uses LLMs to generate personalized multisensory study environments. Users select or generate customized visual themes (e.g., abstract vs. realistic, static vs. animated) and auditory elements (e.g., white noise, ambient ASMR, familiar vs. novel sounds) to create immersive settings aimed at reducing distraction and enhancing emotional stability. Our primary research question investigates how combinations of personalized audiovisual elements affect learner cognitive load and engagement. Using a mixed-methods design that incorporates biometric measures and performance outcomes, this study evaluates the effectiveness of LLM-driven sensory personalization. The findings aim to advance emotionally responsive educational technologies and extend the application of multimodal LLMs into the sensory dimension of self-directed learning.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03033.pdf,"George Xi Wang, Jingying Deng, Safinah Ali",cs.AI
MORE: Mobile Manipulation Rearrangement Through Grounded Language Reasoning,"Autonomous long-horizon mobile manipulation encompasses a multitude of challenges, including scene dynamics, unexplored areas, and error recovery. Recent works have leveraged foundation models for scene-level robotic reasoning and planning. However, the performance of these methods degrades when dealing with a large number of objects and large-scale environments. To address these limitations, we propose MORE, a novel approach for enhancing the capabilities of language models to solve zero-shot mobile manipulation planning for rearrangement tasks. MORE leverages scene graphs to represent environments, incorporates instance differentiation, and introduces an active filtering scheme that extracts task-relevant subgraphs of object and region instances. These steps yield a bounded planning problem, effectively mitigating hallucinations and improving reliability. Additionally, we introduce several enhancements that enable planning across both indoor and outdoor environments. We evaluate MORE on 81 diverse rearrangement tasks from the BEHAVIOR-1K benchmark, where it becomes the first approach to successfully solve a significant share of the benchmark, outperforming recent foundation model-based approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capabilities of our approach in several complex real-world tasks, mimicking everyday activities.

"Energy, Scalability, Data and Security in Massive IoT: Current Landscape and Future Directions","The Massive Internet of Things (MIoT) envisions an interconnected ecosystem of billions of devices, fundamentally transforming diverse sectors such as healthcare, smart cities, transportation, agriculture, and energy management. However, the vast scale of MIoT introduces significant challenges, including network scalability, efficient data management, energy conservation, and robust security mechanisms. This paper presents a thorough review of existing and emerging MIoT technologies designed to address these challenges, including Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN), 5G/6G capabilities, edge and fog computing architectures, and hybrid access methodologies. We further investigate advanced strategies such as AI-driven resource allocation, federated learning for privacy-preserving analytics, and decentralized security frameworks using blockchain. Additionally, we analyze sustainable practices, emphasizing energy harvesting and integrating green technologies to reduce environmental impact. Through extensive comparative analysis, this study identifies critical innovations and architectural adaptations required to support efficient, resilient, and scalable MIoT deployments. Key insights include the role of network slicing and intelligent resource management for scalability, adaptive protocols for real-time data handling, and lightweight AI models suited to the constraints of MIoT devices. This research ultimately contributes to a deeper understanding of how MIoT systems can evolve to meet the growing demand for seamless, reliable connectivity while prioritizing sustainability, security, and performance across diverse applications.

An Explainable Anomaly Detection Framework for Monitoring Depression and Anxiety Using Consumer Wearable Devices,"Continuous monitoring of behavior and physiology via wearable devices offers a novel, objective method for the early detection of worsening depression and anxiety. In this study, we present an explainable anomaly detection framework that identifies clinically meaningful increases in symptom severity using consumer-grade wearable data. Leveraging data from 2,023 participants with defined healthy baselines, our LSTM autoencoder model learned normal health patterns of sleep duration, step count, and resting heart rate. Anomalies were flagged when self-reported depression or anxiety scores increased by >=5 points (a threshold considered clinically significant). The model achieved an adjusted F1-score of 0.80 (precision = 0.73, recall = 0.88) in detecting 393 symptom-worsening episodes across 341 participants, with higher performance observed for episodes involving concurrent depression and anxiety escalation (F1 = 0.84) and for more pronounced symptom changes (>=10-point increases, F1 = 0.85). Model interpretability was supported by SHAP-based analysis, which identified resting heart rate as the most influential feature in 71.4 percentage of detected anomalies, followed by physical activity and sleep. Together, our findings highlight the potential of explainable anomaly detection to enable personalized, scalable, and proactive mental health monitoring in real-world settings.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03039.pdf,"Yuezhou Zhang, Amos A.

A New Perspective To Understanding Multi-resolution Hash Encoding For Neural Fields,"Instant-NGP has been the state-of-the-art architecture of neural fields in recent years. Its incredible signal-fitting capabilities are generally attributed to its multi-resolution hash grid structure and have been used and improved in numerous following works. However, it is unclear how and why such a hash grid structure improves the capabilities of a neural network by such great margins. A lack of principled understanding of the hash grid also implies that the large set of hyperparameters accompanying Instant-NGP could only be tuned empirically without much heuristics. To provide an intuitive explanation of the working principle of the hash grid, we propose a novel perspective, namely domain manipulation. This perspective provides a ground-up explanation of how the feature grid learns the target signal and increases the expressivity of the neural field by artificially creating multiples of pre-existing linear segments. We conducted numerous experiments on carefully constructed 1-dimensional signals to support our claims empirically and aid our illustrations. While our analysis mainly focuses on 1-dimensional signals, we show that the idea is generalizable to higher dimensions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03042.pdf,Steven Tin Sui Luo,cs.LG
A Modal-Space Formulation for Momentum Observer Contact Estimation and Effects of Uncertainty for Continuum Robots,"Contact detection for continuum and soft robots has been limited in past works to statics or kinematics-based methods with assumed circular bending curvature or known bending profiles. In this paper, we adapt the generalized momentum observer contact estimation method to continuum robots. This is made possible by leveraging recent results for real-time shape sensing of continuum robots along with a modal-space representation of the robot dynamics. In addition to presenting an approach for estimating the generalized forces due to contact via a momentum observer, we present a constrained optimization method to identify the wrench imparted on the robot during contact. We also present an approach for investigating the effects of unmodeled deviations in the robot's dynamic state on the contact detection method and we validate our algorithm by simulations and experiments. We also compare the performance of the momentum observer to the joint force deviation method, a direct estimation approach using the robot's full dynamic model. We also demonstrate a basic extension of the method to multisegment continuum robots. Results presented in this work extend dynamic contact detection to the domain of continuum and soft robots and can be used to improve the safety of large-scale continuum robots for human-robot collaboration.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03044.pdf,"Garrison L.

Sim2Real Transfer for Vision-Based Grasp Verification,"The verification of successful grasps is a crucial aspect of robot manipulation, particularly when handling deformable objects. Traditional methods relying on force and tactile sensors often struggle with deformable and non-rigid objects. In this work, we present a vision-based approach for grasp verification to determine whether the robotic gripper has successfully grasped an object. Our method employs a two-stage architecture; first YOLO-based object detection model to detect and locate the robot's gripper and then a ResNet-based classifier determines the presence of an object. To address the limitations of real-world data capture, we introduce HSR-GraspSynth, a synthetic dataset designed to simulate diverse grasping scenarios. Furthermore, we explore the use of Visual Question Answering capabilities as a zero-shot baseline to which we compare our model. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy in real-world environments, with potential for integration into grasping pipelines.

"34 Examples of LLM Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry: Towards Automation, Assistants, Agents, and Accelerated Scientific Discovery","Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping many aspects of materials science and chemistry research, enabling advances in molecular property prediction, materials design, scientific automation, knowledge extraction, and more. Recent developments demonstrate that the latest class of models are able to integrate structured and unstructured data, assist in hypothesis generation, and streamline research workflows. To explore the frontier of LLM capabilities across the research lifecycle, we review applications of LLMs through 34 total projects developed during the second annual Large Language Model Hackathon for Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry, a global hybrid event. These projects spanned seven key research areas: (1) molecular and material property prediction, (2) molecular and material design, (3) automation and novel interfaces, (4) scientific communication and education, (5) research data management and automation, (6) hypothesis generation and evaluation, and (7) knowledge extraction and reasoning from the scientific literature. Collectively, these applications illustrate how LLMs serve as versatile predictive models, platforms for rapid prototyping of domain-specific tools, and much more. In particular, improvements in both open source and proprietary LLM performance through the addition of reasoning, additional training data, and new techniques have expanded effectiveness, particularly in low-data environments and interdisciplinary research.

Teaching Models to Understand (but not Generate) High-risk Data,"Language model developers typically filter out high-risk content -- such as toxic or copyrighted text -- from their pre-training data to prevent models from generating similar outputs. However, removing such data altogether limits models' ability to recognize and appropriately respond to harmful or sensitive content. In this paper, we introduce Selective Loss to Understand but Not Generate (SLUNG), a pre-training paradigm through which models learn to understand high-risk data without learning to generate it. Instead of uniformly applying the next-token prediction loss, SLUNG selectively avoids incentivizing the generation of high-risk tokens while ensuring they remain within the model's context window. As the model learns to predict low-risk tokens that follow high-risk ones, it is forced to understand the high-risk content. Through our experiments, we show that SLUNG consistently improves models' understanding of high-risk data (e.g., ability to recognize toxic content) without increasing its generation (e.g., toxicity of model responses). Overall, our SLUNG paradigm enables models to benefit from high-risk text that would otherwise be filtered out.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03052.pdf,"Ryan Wang, Matthew Finlayson, Luca Soldaini, Swabha Swayamdipta, Robin Jia",cs.CL
Developing A Framework to Support Human Evaluation of Bias in Generated Free Response Text,"LLM evaluation is challenging even the case of base models. In real world deployments, evaluation is further complicated by the interplay of task specific prompts and experiential context. At scale, bias evaluation is often based on short context, fixed choice benchmarks that can be rapidly evaluated, however, these can lose validity when the LLMs' deployed context differs. Large scale human evaluation is often seen as too intractable and costly. Here we present our journey towards developing a semi-automated bias evaluation framework for free text responses that has human insights at its core. We discuss how we developed an operational definition of bias that helped us automate our pipeline and a methodology for classifying bias beyond multiple choice. We additionally comment on how human evaluation helped us uncover problematic templates in a bias benchmark.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03053.pdf,"Jennifer Healey, Laurie Byrum, Md Nadeem Akhtar, Surabhi Bhargava, Moumita Sinha",cs.CL
BLAB: Brutally Long Audio Bench,"Developing large audio language models (LMs) capable of understanding diverse spoken interactions is essential for accommodating the multimodal nature of human communication and can increase the accessibility of language technologies across different user populations. Recent work on audio LMs has primarily evaluated their performance on short audio segments, typically under 30 seconds, with limited exploration of long-form conversational speech segments that more closely reflect natural user interactions with these models. We introduce Brutally Long Audio Bench (BLAB), a challenging long-form audio benchmark that evaluates audio LMs on localization, duration estimation, emotion, and counting tasks using audio segments averaging 51 minutes in length. BLAB consists of 833+ hours of diverse, full-length audio clips, each paired with human-annotated, text-based natural language questions and answers. Our audio data were collected from permissively licensed sources and underwent a human-assisted filtering process to ensure task compliance. We evaluate six open-source and proprietary audio LMs on BLAB and find that all of them, including advanced models such as Gemini 2.0 Pro and GPT-4o, struggle with the tasks in BLAB. Our comprehensive analysis reveals key insights into the trade-offs between task difficulty and audio duration. In general, we find that audio LMs struggle with long-form speech, with performance declining as duration increases. They perform poorly on localization, temporal reasoning, counting, and struggle to understand non-phonemic information, relying more on prompts than audio content. BLAB serves as a challenging evaluation framework to develop audio LMs with robust long-form audio understanding capabilities.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03054.pdf,"Orevaoghene Ahia, Martijn Bartelds, Kabir Ahuja, Hila Gonen, Valentin Hofmann, Siddhant Arora, Shuyue Stella Li, Vishal Puttagunta, Mofetoluwa Adeyemi, Charishma Buchireddy, Ben Walls, Noah Bennett, Shinji Watanabe, Noah A.

$\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction of linear quadratic-output systems by multivariate rational interpolation,"This paper addresses the $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal approximation of linear dynamical systems with quadratic-output functions, also known as linear quadratic-output systems. Our major contributions are threefold. First, we derive interpolation-based first-order optimality conditions for the linear quadratic-output $\mathcal{H}_2$ minimization problem. These conditions correspond to the mixed-multipoint tangential interpolation of the full-order linear- and quadratic-output transfer functions, and generalize the Meier-Luenberger optimality framework for the $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction of linear time-invariant systems. Second, given the interpolation data, we show how to enforce these mixed-multipoint tangential interpolation conditions explicitly by Petrov-Galerkin projection of the full-order model matrices. Third, to find the optimal interpolation data, we build on this projection framework and propose a generalization of the iterative rational Krylov algorithm for the $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction of linear quadratic-output systems, called LQO-IRKA. Upon convergence, LQO-IRKA produces a reduced linear quadratic-output system that satisfies the interpolatory optimality conditions. The method only requires solving shifted linear systems and matrix-vector products, thus making it suitable for large-scale problems. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03057.pdf,"Sean Reiter, Ion Victor Gosea, Igor Pontes Duff, Serkan Gugercin",math.NA
Improving Model Alignment Through Collective Intelligence of Open-Source LLMS,"Building helpful and harmless large language models (LLMs) requires effective model alignment approach based on human instructions and feedback, which necessitates high-quality human-labeled data. Constructing such datasets is often expensive and hard to scale, and may face potential limitations on diversity and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce Mixture of Agents Alignment (MoAA), that leverages the collective strengths of various language models to provide high-quality data for model alignment. By employing MoAA, we enhance both supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, leading to improved performance compared to using a single model alone to generate alignment data (e.g. using GPT-4o alone). Evaluation results show that our approach can improve win rate of LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct from 19.5 to 48.3 on Arena-Hard and from 22.33 to 57.23 on AlpacaEval2, highlighting a promising direction for model alignment through this new scalable and diverse synthetic data recipe. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MoAA enables a self-improvement pipeline, where models finetuned on MoA-generated data surpass their own initial capabilities, providing evidence that our approach can push the frontier of open-source LLMs without reliance on stronger external supervision. Data and code will be released.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03059.pdf,"Junlin Wang, Roy Xie, Shang Zhu, Jue Wang, Ben Athiwaratkun, Bhuwan Dhingra, Shuaiwen Leon Song, Ce Zhang, James Zou",cs.CL
Testing SSD Firmware with State Data-Aware Fuzzing: Accelerating Coverage in Nondeterministic I/O Environments,"Solid-State Drive (SSD) firmware manages complex internal states, including flash memory maintenance. Due to nondeterministic I/O operations, traditional testing methods struggle to rapidly achieve coverage of firmware code areas that require extensive I/O accumulation. To address this challenge, we propose a state data-aware fuzzing approach that leverages SSD firmware's internal state to guide input generation under nondeterministic I/O conditions and accelerate coverage discovery. Our experiments with an open-source SSD firmware emulator show that the proposed method achieves the same firmware test coverage as a state-of-the-art coverage-based fuzzer (AFL++) while requiring approximately 67% fewer commands, without reducing the number of crashes or hangs detected. Moreover, we extend our experiments by incorporating various I/O commands beyond basic write/read operations to reflect real user scenarios, and we confirm that our strategy remains effective even for multiple types of I/O tests. We further validate the effectiveness of state data-aware fuzzing for firmware testing under I/O environments and suggest that this approach can be extended to other storage firmware or threshold-based embedded systems in the future.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03062.pdf,"Gangho Yoon, Eunseok Lee",cs.SE
Multiscale Parallel Simulation of Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma via Adaptive Domain Partitioning -- an Efficiency Analysis Study,"A novel parallel efficiency analysis on a framework for simulating the growth of Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) tumours is presented. Proliferation of MPM tumours in the pleural space is simulated using a Cellular Potts Model (CPM) coupled with partial differential equations (PDEs). Using segmented lung data from CT scans, an environment is set up with artificial tumour data in the pleural space, representing the simulation domain, onto which a dynamic bounding box is applied to restrict computations to the region of interest, dramatically reducing memory and CPU overhead. This adaptive partitioning of the domain enables efficient use of computational resources by reducing the three-dimensional (3D) domain over which the PDEs are to be solved. The PDEs, representing oxygen, nutrients, and cytokines, are solved using the finite-volume method with a first-order implicit Euler scheme. Parallelization is realized using the public Python library mpi4py in combination with LinearGMRESSolver and PETSc for efficient convergence. Performance analyses have shown that parallelization achieves a reduced solving time compared to serial computation. Also, optimizations enable efficient use of available memory and improved load balancing amongst the cores.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03067.pdf,"Anton Dolganov, Valeria Krzhizhanovskaya, Stefano Trebeschi, Vivek M.

Robustly Invertible Nonlinear Dynamics and the BiLipREN: Contracting Neural Models with Contracting Inverses,"We study the invertibility of nonlinear dynamical systems from the perspective of contraction and incremental stability analysis and propose a new invertible recurrent neural model: the BiLipREN. In particular, we consider a nonlinear state space model to be robustly invertible if an inverse exists with a state space realisation, and both the forward model and its inverse are contracting, i.e. incrementally exponentially stable, and Lipschitz, i.e. have bounded incremental gain. This property of bi-Lipschitzness implies both robustness in the sense of sensitivity to input perturbations, as well as robust distinguishability of different inputs from their corresponding outputs, i.e. the inverse model robustly reconstructs the input sequence despite small perturbations to the initial conditions and measured output. Building on this foundation, we propose a parameterization of neural dynamic models: bi-Lipschitz recurrent equilibrium networks (biLipREN), which are robustly invertible by construction. Moreover, biLipRENs can be composed with orthogonal linear systems to construct more general bi-Lipschitz dynamic models, e.g., a nonlinear analogue of minimum-phase/all-pass (inner/outer) factorization. We illustrate the utility of our proposed approach with numerical examples.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03069.pdf,"Yurui Zhang, Ruigang Wang, Ian R. Manchester",eess.SY

Coupling the Heart to Musical Machines,"Biofeedback is being used more recently as a general control paradigm for human-computer interfaces (HCIs). While biofeedback especially from breath has seen increasing uptake as a controller for novel musical interfaces, new interfaces for musical expression (NIMEs), the community has not given as much attention to the heart. The heart is just as intimate a part of music as breath and it is argued that the heart determines our perception of time and so indirectly our perception of music. Inspired by this I demonstrate a photoplethysmogram (PPG)-based NIME controller using heart rate as a 1D control parameter to transform the qualities of sounds in real-time over a Bluetooth wireless HCI. I apply time scaling to ""warp"" audio buffers inbound to the sound card, and play these transformed audio buffers back to the listener wearing the PPG sensor, creating a hypothetical perceptual biofeedback loop: changes in sound change heart rate to change PPG measurements to change sound. I discuss how a sound-heart-PPG biofeedback loop possibly affords greater control and/or variety of movements with a 1D controller, how controlling the space and/or time scale of sound playback with biofeedback makes for possibilities in performance ambience, and I briefly discuss generative latent spaces as a possible way to extend a 1D PPG control space.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03073.pdf,Eric Easthope,cs.HC
Layer Potential Methods for Doubly-Periodic Harmonic Functions,"We develop and analyze layer potential methods to represent harmonic functions on finitely-connected tori (i.e., doubly-periodic harmonic functions). The layer potentials are expressed in terms of a doubly-periodic and non-harmonic Green's function that can be explicitly written in terms of the Jacobi theta function or a modified Weierstrass sigma function. Extending results for finitely-connected Euclidean domains, we prove that the single- and double-layer potential operators are compact linear operators and derive relevant limiting properties at the boundary. We show that when the boundary has more than one connected component, the Fredholm operator of the second kind associated with the double-layer potential operator has a non-trivial null space, which can be explicitly constructed. Finally, we apply our developed theory to obtain solutions to the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems, as well as the Steklov eigenvalue problem. We implement the developed methods using Nystr\""om discretization and find approximate solutions for these problems in several numerical examples. Our method avoids a lattice sum of the free space Green's function, is shown to be spectrally convergent, and has a faster convergence rate than the method of particular solutions for problems on tori with irregularly shaped holes.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03074.pdf,"Bohyun Kim, Braxton Osting",math.NA
Direct Retrieval-augmented Optimization: Synergizing Knowledge Selection and Language Models,"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) integrates large language models ( LLM s) with retrievers to access external knowledge, improving the factuality of LLM generation in knowledge-grounded tasks. To optimize the RAG performance, most previous work independently fine-tunes the retriever to adapt to frozen LLM s or trains the LLMs to use documents retrieved by off-the-shelf retrievers, lacking end-to-end training supervision. Recent work addresses this limitation by jointly training these two components but relies on overly simplifying assumptions of document independence, which has been criticized for being far from real-world scenarios. Thus, effectively optimizing the overall RAG performance remains a critical challenge.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03075.pdf,"Zhengliang Shi, Lingyong Yan, Weiwei Sun, Yue Feng, Pengjie Ren, Xinyu Ma, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Maarten de Rijke, Zhaochun Ren",cs.IR
Latent Adaptive Planner for Dynamic Manipulation,"This paper presents Latent Adaptive Planner (LAP), a novel approach for dynamic nonprehensile manipulation tasks that formulates planning as latent space inference, effectively learned from human demonstration videos. Our method addresses key challenges in visuomotor policy learning through a principled variational replanning framework that maintains temporal consistency while efficiently adapting to environmental changes. LAP employs Bayesian updating in latent space to incrementally refine plans as new observations become available, striking an optimal balance between computational efficiency and real-time adaptability. We bridge the embodiment gap between humans and robots through model-based proportional mapping that regenerates accurate kinematic-dynamic joint states and object positions from human demonstrations. Experimental evaluations across multiple complex manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that LAP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing approaches in success rate, trajectory smoothness, and energy efficiency, particularly in dynamic adaptation scenarios. Our approach enables robots to perform complex interactions with human-like adaptability while providing an expandable framework applicable to diverse robotic platforms using the same human demonstration videos.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03077.pdf,"Donghun Noh, Deqian Kong, Minglu Zhao, Andrew Lizarraga, Jianwen Xie, Ying Nian Wu, Dennis Hong",cs.RO
Coevolution of Actions and Opinions in Networks of Coordinating and Anti-Coordinating Agents,"In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of coordinating and anti-coordinating agents in a coevolutionary model for actions and opinions. In the model, the individuals of a population interact on a two-layer network, sharing their opinions and observing others' action, while revising their own opinions and actions according to a game-theoretic mechanism, grounded in the social psychology literature. First, we consider the scenario of coordinating agents, where convergence to a Nash equilibrium (NE) is guaranteed. We identify conditions for reaching consensus configurations and establish regions of attraction for these equilibria. Second, we study networks of anti-coordinating agents. In this second scenario, we prove that all trajectories converge to a NE by leveraging potential game theory. Then, we establish analytical conditions on the network structure and model parameters to guarantee the existence of consensus and polarized equilibria, characterizing their regions of attraction.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03078.pdf,"Hong Liang, Mengbin Ye, Lorenzo Zino, Weiguo Xia",cs.GT
An Empirical Study on the Impact of Gender Diversity on Code Quality in AI Systems,"The rapid advancement of AI systems necessitates high-quality, sustainable code to ensure reliability and mitigate risks such as bias and technical debt. However, the underrepresentation of women in software engineering raises concerns about homogeneity in AI development. Studying gender diversity in AI systems is crucial, as diverse perspectives are essential for improving system robustness, reducing bias, and enhancing overall code quality. While prior research has demonstrated the benefits of diversity in general software teams, its specific impact on the code quality of AI systems remains unexplored. This study addresses this gap by examining how gender diversity within AI teams influences project popularity, code quality, and individual contributions. Our study makes three key contributions. First, we analyzed the relationship between team diversity and repository popularity, revealing that diverse AI repositories not only differ significantly from non-diverse ones but also achieve higher popularity and greater community engagement. Second, we explored the effect of diversity on the overall code quality of AI systems and found that diverse repositories tend to have superior code quality compared to non-diverse ones. Finally, our analysis of individual contributions revealed that although female contributors contribute to a smaller proportion of the total code, their contributions demonstrate consistently higher quality than those of their male counterparts. These findings highlight the need to remove barriers to female participation in AI development, as greater diversity can improve the overall quality of AI systems.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03082.pdf,"Shamse Tasnim Cynthia, Banani Roy",cs.SE
Adversarial Attacks in Multimodal Systems: A Practitioner's Survey,"The introduction of multimodal models is a huge step forward in Artificial Intelligence. A single model is trained to understand multiple modalities: text, image, video, and audio. Open-source multimodal models have made these breakthroughs more accessible. However, considering the vast landscape of adversarial attacks across these modalities, these models also inherit vulnerabilities of all the modalities, and ultimately, the adversarial threat amplifies. While broad research is available on possible attacks within or across these modalities, a practitioner-focused view that outlines attack types remains absent in the multimodal world. As more Machine Learning Practitioners adopt, fine-tune, and deploy open-source models in real-world applications, it's crucial that they can view the threat landscape and take the preventive actions necessary. This paper addresses the gap by surveying adversarial attacks targeting all four modalities: text, image, video, and audio. This survey provides a view of the adversarial attack landscape and presents how multimodal adversarial threats have evolved. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first comprehensive summarization of the threat landscape in the multimodal world.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03084.pdf,"Shashank Kapoor, Sanjay Surendranath Girija, Lakshit Arora, Dipen Pradhan, Ankit Shetgaonkar, Aman Raj",cs.LG
Fabrication and Characterization of Additively Manufactured Stretchable Strain Sensors Towards the Shape Sensing of Continuum Robots,"This letter describes the manufacturing and experimental characterization of novel stretchable strain sensors for continuum robots. The overarching goal of this research is to provide a new solution for the shape sensing of these devices. The sensors are fabricated via direct ink writing, an extrusion-based additive manufacturing technique. Electrically conductive material (i.e., the \textit{ink}) is printed into traces whose electrical resistance varies in response to mechanical deformation. The principle of operation of stretchable strain sensors is analogous to that of conventional strain gauges, but with a significantly larger operational window thanks to their ability to withstand larger strain. Among the different conductive materials considered for this study, we opted to fabricate the sensors with a high-viscosity eutectic Gallium-Indium ink, which in initial testing exhibited high linearity ($R^2 \approx$ 0.99), gauge factor $\approx$ 1, and negligible drift. Benefits of the proposed sensors include (i) ease of fabrication, as they can be conveniently printed in a matter of minutes; (ii) ease of installation, as they can simply be glued to the outside body of a robot; (iii) ease of miniaturization, which enables integration into millimiter-sized continuum robots.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03087.pdf,"Daniel C.

"Global Task-aware Fault Detection, Identification For On-Orbit Multi-Spacecraft Collaborative Inspection","In this paper, we present a global-to-local task-aware fault detection and identification algorithm to detect failures in a multi-spacecraft system performing a collaborative inspection (referred to as global) task. The inspection task is encoded as a cost functional $\costH$ that informs global (task allocation and assignment) and local (agent-level) decision-making. The metric $\costH$ is a function of the inspection sensor model, and the agent full-pose. We use the cost functional $\costH$ to design a metric that compares the expected and actual performance to detect the faulty agent using a threshold. We use higher-order cost gradients $\costH$ to derive a new metric to identify the type of fault, including task-specific sensor fault, an agent-level actuator, and sensor faults. Furthermore, we propose an approach to design adaptive thresholds for each fault mentioned above to incorporate the time dependence of the inspection task. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method empirically, by simulating and detecting faults (such as inspection sensor faults, actuators, and sensor faults) in a low-Earth orbit collaborative spacecraft inspection task using the metrics and the threshold designed using the global task cost $\costH$.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03088.pdf,"Akshita Gupta, Yashwanth Kumar Nakka, Changrak Choi, Amir Rahmani",eess.SY

The use of static RIS configurations tailored to specific environments eliminates the need for dynamic reconfigurations, enhancing system agility, reducing processing complexity, and improving sensing accuracy. The system incorporates trilateration, angle of arrival, and time of arrival techniques to enable precise user localization by combining signals reflected along multiple paths. This method helps choose the best connections and lowers sensing costs while preventing interference with communication data, highlighting the need to bring together new technologies like passive and adaptive beamforming in one system.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03090.pdf,"Rafael Augusto Pedriali, Isadora Martines Ferreira, Jose Carlos Marinello, Taufik Abrao",eess.SY
Estimating the Diameter at Breast Height of Trees in a Forest With a Single 360 Camera,"Forest inventories rely on accurate measurements of the diameter at breast height (DBH) for ecological monitoring, resource management, and carbon accounting. While LiDAR-based techniques can achieve centimeter-level precision, they are cost-prohibitive and operationally complex. We present a low-cost alternative that only needs a consumer-grade 360 video camera. Our semi-automated pipeline comprises of (i) a dense point cloud reconstruction using Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry software called Agisoft Metashape, (ii) semantic trunk segmentation by projecting Grounded Segment Anything (SAM) masks onto the 3D cloud, and (iii) a robust RANSAC-based technique to estimate cross section shape and DBH. We introduce an interactive visualization tool for inspecting segmented trees and their estimated DBH. On 61 acquisitions of 43 trees under a variety of conditions, our method attains median absolute relative errors of 5-9% with respect to ""ground-truth"" manual measurements. This is only 2-4% higher than LiDAR-based estimates, while employing a single 360 camera that costs orders of magnitude less, requires minimal setup, and is widely available.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03093.pdf,"Siming He, Zachary Osman, Fernando Cladera, Dexter Ong, Nitant Rai, Patrick Corey Green, Vijay Kumar, Pratik Chaudhari",cs.CV
Analysis of beam hardening streaks in tomography,"The mathematical foundation of X-ray CT is based on the assumption that by measuring the attenuation of X-rays passing through an object, one can recover the integrals of the attenuation coefficient $\mu(x)$ along a sufficiently rich family of lines $L$, $\int_L \mu(x) \text{d} x$. This assumption is inaccurate because the energy spectrum of an X-ray beam in a typical CT scanner is wide. At the same time, the X-ray attenuation coefficient of most materials is energy-dependent, and this dependence varies among materials. Thus, reconstruction from X-ray CT data is a nonlinear problem. If the nonlinear nature of CT data is ignored and a conventional linear reconstruction formula is used, which is frequently the case, the resulting image contains beam-hardening artifacts such as streaks. In this work, we describe the nonlinearity of CT data using the conventional model accepted by all CT practitioners. Our main result is the characterization of streak artifacts caused by nonlinearity. We also obtain an explicit expression for the leading singular behavior of the artifacts. Finally, a numerical experiment is conducted to validate the theoretical results.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03095.pdf,Alexander Katsevich,math.NA
Assessing and Enhancing the Robustness of LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems Through Chaos Engineering,"This study explores the application of chaos engineering to enhance the robustness of Large Language Model-Based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) in production-like environments under real-world conditions. LLM-MAS can potentially improve a wide range of tasks, from answering questions and generating content to automating customer support and improving decision-making processes. However, LLM-MAS in production or preproduction environments can be vulnerable to emergent errors or disruptions, such as hallucinations, agent failures, and agent communication failures. This study proposes a chaos engineering framework to proactively identify such vulnerabilities in LLM-MAS, assess and build resilience against them, and ensure reliable performance in critical applications.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03096.pdf,Joshua Owotogbe,cs.MA
Not All Parameters Matter: Masking Diffusion Models for Enhancing Generation Ability,"The diffusion models, in early stages focus on constructing basic image structures, while the refined details, including local features and textures, are generated in later stages. Thus the same network layers are forced to learn both structural and textural information simultaneously, significantly differing from the traditional deep learning architectures (e.g., ResNet or GANs) which captures or generates the image semantic information at different layers. This difference inspires us to explore the time-wise diffusion models. We initially investigate the key contributions of the U-Net parameters to the denoising process and identify that properly zeroing out certain parameters (including large parameters) contributes to denoising, substantially improving the generation quality on the fly. Capitalizing on this discovery, we propose a simple yet effective method-termed ``MaskUNet''- that enhances generation quality with negligible parameter numbers. Our method fully leverages timestep- and sample-dependent effective U-Net parameters. To optimize MaskUNet, we offer two fine-tuning strategies: a training-based approach and a training-free approach, including tailored networks and optimization functions. In zero-shot inference on the COCO dataset, MaskUNet achieves the best FID score and further demonstrates its effectiveness in downstream task evaluations.

Towards a standardized methodology and dataset for evaluating LLM-based digital forensic timeline analysis,"Large language models (LLMs) have seen widespread adoption in many domains including digital forensics. While prior research has largely centered on case studies and examples demonstrating how LLMs can assist forensic investigations, deeper explorations remain limited, i.e., a standardized approach for precise performance evaluations is lacking. Inspired by the NIST Computer Forensic Tool Testing Program, this paper proposes a standardized methodology to quantitatively evaluate the application of LLMs for digital forensic tasks, specifically in timeline analysis. The paper describes the components of the methodology, including the dataset, timeline generation, and ground truth development. Additionally, the paper recommends using BLEU and ROUGE metrics for the quantitative evaluation of LLMs through case studies or tasks involving timeline analysis. Experimental results using ChatGPT demonstrate that the proposed methodology can effectively evaluate LLM-based forensic timeline analysis. Finally, we discuss the limitations of applying LLMs to forensic timeline analysis.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03100.pdf,"Hudan Studiawan, Frank Breitinger, Mark Scanlon",cs.CR

"Cognitio Emergens: Agency, Dimensions, and Dynamics in Human-AI Knowledge Co-Creation","Scientific knowledge creation is fundamentally transforming as humans and AI systems evolve beyond tool-user relationships into co-evolutionary epistemic partnerships. When AlphaFold revolutionized protein structure prediction, researchers described engaging with an epistemic partner that reshaped how they conceptualized fundamental relationships. This article introduces Cognitio Emergens (CE), a framework addressing critical limitations in existing models that focus on static roles or narrow metrics while failing to capture how scientific understanding emerges through recursive human-AI interaction over time. CE integrates three components addressing these limitations: Agency Configurations describing how authority distributes between humans and AI (Directed, Contributory, Partnership), with partnerships dynamically oscillating between configurations rather than following linear progression; Epistemic Dimensions capturing six specific capabilities emerging through collaboration across Discovery, Integration, and Projection axes, creating distinctive ""capability signatures"" that guide development; and Partnership Dynamics identifying forces shaping how these relationships evolve, particularly the risk of epistemic alienation where researchers lose interpretive control over knowledge they formally endorse. Drawing from autopoiesis theory, social systems theory, and organizational modularity, CE reveals how knowledge co-creation emerges through continuous negotiation of roles, values, and organizational structures. By reconceptualizing human-AI scientific collaboration as fundamentally co-evolutionary, CE offers a balanced perspective that neither uncritically celebrates nor unnecessarily fears AI's evolving role, instead providing conceptual tools for cultivating partnerships that maintain meaningful human participation while enabling transformative scientific breakthroughs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03105.pdf,Xule Lin,cs.HC
"Is AI currently capable of identifying wild oysters? A comparison of human annotators against the AI model, ODYSSEE","Oysters are ecologically and commercially important species that require frequent monitoring to track population demographics (e.g. abundance, growth, mortality). Current methods of monitoring oyster reefs often require destructive sampling methods and extensive manual effort. Therefore, they are suboptimal for small-scale or sensitive environments. A recent alternative, the ODYSSEE model, was developed to use deep learning techniques to identify live oysters using video or images taken in the field of oyster reefs to assess abundance. The validity of this model in identifying live oysters on a reef was compared to expert and non-expert annotators. In addition, we identified potential sources of prediction error. Although the model can make inferences significantly faster than expert and non-expert annotators (39.6 s, $2.34 \pm 0.61$ h, $4.50 \pm 1.46$ h, respectively), the model overpredicted the number of live oysters, achieving lower accuracy (63\%) in identifying live oysters compared to experts (74\%) and non-experts (75\%) alike. Image quality was an important factor in determining the accuracy of the model and the annotators. Better quality images improved human accuracy and worsened model accuracy. Although ODYSSEE was not sufficiently accurate, we anticipate that future training on higher-quality images, utilizing additional live imagery, and incorporating additional annotation training classes will greatly improve the model's predictive power based on the results of this analysis. Future research should address methods that improve the detection of living vs. dead oysters.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03108.pdf,"Brendan Campbell, Alan Williams, Kleio Baxevani, Alyssa Campbell, Rushabh Dhoke, Rileigh E.

Deep Learning in Renewable Energy Forecasting: A Cross-Dataset Evaluation of Temporal and Spatial Models,"Unpredictability of renewable energy sources coupled with the complexity of those methods used for various purposes in this area calls for the development of robust methods such as DL models within the renewable energy domain. Given the nonlinear relationships among variables in renewable energy datasets, DL models are preferred over traditional machine learning (ML) models because they can effectively capture and model complex interactions between variables. This research aims to identify the factors responsible for the accuracy of DL techniques, such as sampling, stationarity, linearity, and hyperparameter optimization for different algorithms. The proposed DL framework compares various methods and alternative training/test ratios. Seven ML methods, such as Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked LSTM, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), CNN-LSTM, Deep Neural Network (DNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Encoder-Decoder (ED), were evaluated on two different datasets. The first dataset contains the weather and power generation data. It encompasses two distinct datasets, hourly energy demand data and hourly weather data in Spain, while the second dataset includes power output generated by the photovoltaic panels at 12 locations. This study deploys regularization approaches, including early stopping, neuron dropping, and L2 regularization, to reduce the overfitting problem associated with DL models.

Their validation data exhibit exceptionally low root mean square error values.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03109.pdf,"Lutfu Sua, Haibo Wang, Jun Huang",cs.LG
"Plug-and-Play AMC: Context Is King in Training-Free, Open-Set Modulation with LLMs","Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is critical for efficient spectrum management and robust wireless communications. However, AMC remains challenging due to the complex interplay of signal interference and noise. In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates traditional signal processing techniques with Large-Language Models (LLMs) to address AMC. Our approach leverages higher-order statistics and cumulant estimation to convert quantitative signal features into structured natural language prompts. By incorporating exemplar contexts into these prompts, our method exploits the LLM's inherent familiarity with classical signal processing, enabling effective one-shot classification without additional training or preprocessing (e.g., denoising). Experimental evaluations on synthetically generated datasets, spanning both noiseless and noisy conditions, demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance across diverse modulation schemes and Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). Moreover, our approach paves the way for robust foundation models in wireless communications across varying channel conditions, significantly reducing the expense associated with developing channel-specific models. This work lays the foundation for scalable, interpretable, and versatile signal classification systems in next-generation wireless networks.

Unlike convolutional neural networks, vision transformers inherently capture long-range dependencies and enable parallel processing, yet lack inductive biases and efficiency benefits, facing significant computational and memory challenges that limit its real-world applicability. This paper surveys various online strategies for generating lightweight vision transformers for image recognition, focusing on three key areas: Efficient Component Design, Dynamic Network, and Knowledge Distillation. We evaluate the relevant exploration for each topic on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, analyzing trade-offs among precision, parameters, throughput, and more to highlight their respective advantages, disadvantages, and flexibility.

Path and Bone-Contour Regularized Unpaired MRI-to-CT Translation,"Accurate MRI-to-CT translation promises the integration of complementary imaging information without the need for additional imaging sessions. Given the practical challenges associated with acquiring paired MRI and CT scans, the development of robust methods capable of leveraging unpaired datasets is essential for advancing the MRI-to-CT translation. Current unpaired MRI-to-CT translation methods, which predominantly rely on cycle consistency and contrastive learning frameworks, frequently encounter challenges in accurately translating anatomical features that are highly discernible on CT but less distinguishable on MRI, such as bone structures. This limitation renders these approaches less suitable for applications in radiation therapy, where precise bone representation is essential for accurate treatment planning. To address this challenge, we propose a path- and bone-contour regularized approach for unpaired MRI-to-CT translation. In our method, MRI and CT images are projected to a shared latent space, where the MRI-to-CT mapping is modeled as a continuous flow governed by neural ordinary differential equations. The optimal mapping is obtained by minimizing the transition path length of the flow. To enhance the accuracy of translated bone structures, we introduce a trainable neural network to generate bone contours from MRI and implement mechanisms to directly and indirectly encourage the model to focus on bone contours and their adjacent regions. Evaluations conducted on three datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing unpaired MRI-to-CT translation approaches, achieving lower overall error rates. Moreover, in a downstream bone segmentation task, our approach exhibits superior performance in preserving the fidelity of bone structures.

TimeTracker: Event-based Continuous Point Tracking for Video Frame Interpolation with Non-linear Motion,"Video frame interpolation (VFI) that leverages the bio-inspired event cameras as guidance has recently shown better performance and memory efficiency than the frame-based methods, thanks to the event cameras' advantages, such as high temporal resolution. A hurdle for event-based VFI is how to effectively deal with non-linear motion, caused by the dynamic changes in motion direction and speed within the scene. Existing methods either use events to estimate sparse optical flow or fuse events with image features to estimate dense optical flow. Unfortunately, motion errors often degrade the VFI quality as the continuous motion cues from events do not align with the dense spatial information of images in the temporal dimension. In this paper, we find that object motion is continuous in space, tracking local regions over continuous time enables more accurate identification of spatiotemporal feature correlations. In light of this, we propose a novel continuous point tracking-based VFI framework, named TimeTracker. Specifically, we first design a Scene-Aware Region Segmentation (SARS) module to divide the scene into similar patches. Then, a Continuous Trajectory guided Motion Estimation (CTME) module is proposed to track the continuous motion trajectory of each patch through events. Finally, intermediate frames at any given time are generated through global motion optimization and frame refinement. Moreover, we collect a real-world dataset that features fast non-linear motion. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms prior arts in both motion estimation and frame interpolation quality.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03116.pdf,"Haoyue Liu, Jinghan Xu, Yi Chang, Hanyu Zhou, Haozhi Zhao, Lin Wang, Luxin Yan",cs.CV
"Do ATCOs Need Explanations, and Why? Towards ATCO-Centered Explainable AI for Conflict Resolution Advisories","Interest in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is surging. Prior research has primarily focused on systems' ability to generate explanations, often guided by researchers' intuitions rather than end-users' needs. Unfortunately, such approaches have not yielded favorable outcomes when compared to a black-box baseline (i.e., no explanation). To address this gap, this paper advocates a human-centered approach that shifts focus to air traffic controllers (ATCOs) by asking a fundamental yet overlooked question: Do ATCOs need explanations, and if so, why? Insights from air traffic management (ATM), human-computer interaction, and the social sciences were synthesized to provide a holistic understanding of XAI challenges and opportunities in ATM. Evaluating 11 ATM operational goals revealed a clear need for explanations when ATCOs aim to document decisions and rationales for future reference or report generation. Conversely, ATCOs are less likely to seek them when their conflict resolution approach align with the artificial intelligence (AI) advisory. While this is a preliminary study, the findings are expected to inspire broader and deeper inquiries into the design of ATCO-centric XAI systems, paving the way for more effective human-AI interaction in ATM.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03117.pdf,"Katherine Fennedy, Brian Hilburn, Thaivalappil N.

Adaptive Thresholding for Multi-Label Classification via Global-Local Signal Fusion,"Multi-label classification (MLC) requires predicting multiple labels per sample, often under heavy class imbalance and noisy conditions. Traditional approaches apply fixed thresholds or treat labels independently, overlooking context and global rarity. We introduce an adaptive thresholding mechanism that fuses global (IDF-based) and local (KNN-based) signals to produce per-label, per-instance thresholds. Instead of applying these as hard cutoffs, we treat them as differentiable penalties in the loss, providing smooth supervision and better calibration. Our architecture is lightweight, interpretable, and highly modular. On the AmazonCat-13K benchmark, it achieves a macro-F1 of 0.1712, substantially outperforming tree-based and pretrained transformer-based methods. We release full code for reproducibility and future extensions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03118.pdf,Dmytro Shamatrin,cs.LG

"Integrated Sensing, Computing, Communication, and Control for Time-Sequence-Based Semantic Communications","In the upcoming industrial internet of things (IIoT) era, a surge of task-oriented applications will rely on real-time wireless control systems (WCSs). For these systems, ultra-reliable and low-latency wireless communication will be crucial to ensure the timely transmission of control information. To achieve this purpose, we propose a novel time-sequence-based semantic communication paradigm, where an integrated sensing, computing, communication, and control (ISC3) architecture is developed to make sensible semantic inference (SI) for the control information over time sequences, enabling adaptive control of the robot. However, due to the causal correlations in the time sequence, the control information does not present the Markov property. To address this challenge, we compute the mutual information of the control information sensed at the transmitter (Tx) over different time and identify their temporal semantic correlation via a semantic feature extractor (SFE) module. By this means, highly correlated information transmission can be avoided, thus greatly reducing the communication overhead. Meanwhile, a semantic feature reconstructor (SFR) module is employed at the receiver (Rx) to reconstruct the control information based on the previously received one if the information transmission is not activated at the Tx. Furthermore, a control gain policy is also employed at the Rx to adaptively adjust the control gain for the controlled target based on several practical aspects such as the quality of the information transmission from the Tx to the Rx.

HCOA*: Hierarchical Class-ordered A* for Navigation in Semantic Environments,"This paper addresses the problem of robot navigation in mixed geometric and semantic 3D environments. Given a hierarchical representation of the environment, the objective is to navigate from a start position to a goal while minimizing the computational cost. We introduce Hierarchical Class-ordered A* (HCOA*), an algorithm that leverages the environmental hierarchy for efficient path-planning in semantic graphs, significantly reducing computational effort. We use a total order over the semantic classes and prove theoretical performance guarantees for the algorithm. We propose two approaches for higher-layer node classification based on the node semantics of the lowest layer: a Graph Neural Network-based method and a Majority-Class method. We evaluate our approach through simulations on a 3D Scene Graph (3DSG), comparing it to the state-of-the-art and assessing its performance against our classification approaches. Results show that HCOA* can find the optimal path while reducing the number of expanded nodes by 25% and achieving a 16% reduction in computational time on the uHumans2 3DSG dataset.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03128.pdf,"Evangelos Psomiadis, Panagiotis Tsiotras",cs.RO
Advancing Symbolic Discovery on Unsupervised Data: A Pre-training Framework for Non-degenerate Implicit Equation Discovery,"Symbolic regression (SR) -- which learns symbolic equations to describe the underlying relation from input-output pairs -- is widely used for scientific discovery. However, a rich set of scientific data from the real world (e.g., particle trajectories and astrophysics) are typically unsupervised, devoid of explicit input-output pairs. In this paper, we focus on symbolic implicit equation discovery, which aims to discover the mathematical relation from unsupervised data that follows an implicit equation $f(\mathbf{x}) =0$. However, due to the dense distribution of degenerate solutions (e.g., $f(\mathbf{x})=x_i-x_i$) in the discrete search space, most existing SR approaches customized for this task fail to achieve satisfactory performance. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel pre-training framework -- namely, Pre-trained neural symbolic model for Implicit Equation (PIE) -- to discover implicit equations from unsupervised data. The core idea is that, we formulate the implicit equation discovery on unsupervised scientific data as a translation task and utilize the prior learned from the pre-training dataset to infer non-degenerate skeletons of the underlying relation end-to-end. Extensive experiments shows that, leveraging the prior from a pre-trained language model, PIE effectively tackles the problem of degenerate solutions and significantly outperforms all the existing SR approaches. PIE shows an encouraging step towards general scientific discovery on unsupervised data.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03130.pdf,"Kuang Yufei, Wang Jie, Huang Haotong, Ye Mingxuan, Zhu Fangzhou, Li Xijun, Hao Jianye, Wu Feng",cs.SC
VISLIX: An XAI Framework for Validating Vision Models with Slice Discovery and Analysis,"Real-world machine learning models require rigorous evaluation before deployment, especially in safety-critical domains like autonomous driving and surveillance. The evaluation of machine learning models often focuses on data slices, which are subsets of the data that share a set of characteristics. Data slice finding automatically identifies conditions or data subgroups where models underperform, aiding developers in mitigating performance issues. Despite its popularity and effectiveness, data slicing for vision model validation faces several challenges. First, data slicing often needs additional image metadata or visual concepts, and falls short in certain computer vision tasks, such as object detection. Second, understanding data slices is a labor-intensive and mentally demanding process that heavily relies on the expert's domain knowledge. Third, data slicing lacks a human-in-the-loop solution that allows experts to form hypothesis and test them interactively. To overcome these limitations and better support the machine learning operations lifecycle, we introduce VISLIX, a novel visual analytics framework that employs state-of-the-art foundation models to help domain experts analyze slices in computer vision models. Our approach does not require image metadata or visual concepts, automatically generates natural language insights, and allows users to test data slice hypothesis interactively. We evaluate VISLIX with an expert study and three use cases, that demonstrate the effectiveness of our tool in providing comprehensive insights for validating object detection models.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03132.pdf,"Xinyuan Yan, Xiwei Xuan, Jorge Piazentin Ono, Jiajing Guo, Vikram Mohanty, Shekar Arvind Kumar, Liang Gou, Bei Wang, Liu Ren",cs.CV
Enhancing Glass Defect Detection with Diffusion Models: Addressing Imbalanced Datasets in Manufacturing Quality Control,"Visual defect detection in industrial glass manufacturing remains a critical challenge due to the low frequency of defective products, leading to imbalanced datasets that limit the performance of deep learning models and computer vision systems. This paper presents a novel approach using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to generate synthetic defective glass product images for data augmentation, effectively addressing class imbalance issues in manufacturing quality control and automated visual inspection. The methodology significantly enhances image classification performance of standard CNN architectures (ResNet50V2, EfficientNetB0, and MobileNetV2) in detecting anomalies by increasing the minority class representation. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in key machine learning metrics, particularly in recall for defective samples across all tested deep neural network architectures while maintaining perfect precision. The most dramatic improvement was observed in ResNet50V2's overall classification accuracy, which increased from 78 percent to 93 percent when trained with the augmented data. This work provides a scalable, cost-effective approach to enhancing automated defect detection in glass manufacturing that can potentially be extended to other industrial quality assurance systems and industries with similar class imbalance challenges.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03134.pdf,"Sajjad Rezvani Boroujeni, Hossein Abedi, Tom Bush",cs.CV
Holmes: Automated Fact Check with Large Language Models,"The rise of Internet connectivity has accelerated the spread of disinformation, threatening societal trust, decision-making, and national security. Disinformation has evolved from simple text to complex multimodal forms combining images and text, challenging existing detection methods. Traditional deep learning models struggle to capture the complexity of multimodal disinformation. Inspired by advances in AI, this study explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated disinformation detection. The empirical study shows that (1) LLMs alone cannot reliably assess the truthfulness of claims; (2) providing relevant evidence significantly improves their performance; (3) however, LLMs cannot autonomously search for accurate evidence. To address this, we propose Holmes, an end-to-end framework featuring a novel evidence retrieval method that assists LLMs in collecting high-quality evidence. Our approach uses (1) LLM-powered summarization to extract key information from open sources and (2) a new algorithm and metrics to evaluate evidence quality. Holmes enables LLMs to verify claims and generate justifications effectively. Experiments show Holmes achieves 88.3% accuracy on two open-source datasets and 90.2% in real-time verification tasks. Notably, our improved evidence retrieval boosts fact-checking accuracy by 30.8% over existing methods",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03135.pdf,"Haoran Ou, Gelei Deng, Xingshuo Han, Jie Zhang, Xinlei He, Han Qiu, Shangwei Guo, Tianwei Zhang",cs.AI
Characterising Topic Familiarity and Query Specificity Using Eye-Tracking Data,"Eye-tracking data has been shown to correlate with a user's knowledge level and query formulation behaviour. While previous work has focused primarily on eye gaze fixations for attention analysis, often requiring additional contextual information, our study investigates the memory-related cognitive dimension by relying solely on pupil dilation and gaze velocity to infer users' topic familiarity and query specificity without needing any contextual information. Using eye-tracking data collected via a lab user study (N=18), we achieved a Macro F1 score of 71.25% for predicting topic familiarity with a Gradient Boosting classifier, and a Macro F1 score of 60.54% with a k-nearest neighbours (KNN) classifier for query specificity. Furthermore, we developed a novel annotation guideline -- specifically tailored for question answering -- to manually classify queries as Specific or Non-specific. This study demonstrates the feasibility of eye-tracking to better understand topic familiarity and query specificity in search.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03136.pdf,"Jiaman He, Zikang Leng, Dana McKay, Johanne R.

Edge Large AI Models: Collaborative Deployment and IoT Applications,"Large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) emulate human-like problem-solving capabilities across diverse domains, modalities, and tasks. By leveraging the communication and computation resources of geographically distributed edge devices, edge LAMs enable real-time intelligent services at the network edge. Unlike conventional edge AI, which relies on small or moderate-sized models for direct feature-to-prediction mappings, edge LAMs leverage the intricate coordination of modular components to enable context-aware generative tasks and multi-modal inference. We shall propose a collaborative deployment framework for edge LAM by characterizing the LAM intelligent capabilities and limited edge network resources. Specifically, we propose a collaborative training framework over heterogeneous edge networks that adaptively decomposes LAMs according to computation resources, data modalities, and training objectives, reducing communication and computation overheads during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, we introduce a microservice-based inference framework that virtualizes the functional modules of edge LAMs according to their architectural characteristics, thereby improving resource utilization and reducing inference latency. The developed edge LAM will provide actionable solutions to enable diversified Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, facilitated by constructing mappings from diverse sensor data to token representations and fine-tuning based on domain knowledge.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03139.pdf,"Zixin Wang, Yuanming Shi, Khaled.

Learn to Swim: Data-Driven LSTM Hydrodynamic Model for Quadruped Robot Gait Optimization,"This paper presents a Long Short-Term Memory network-based Fluid Experiment Data-Driven model (FED-LSTM) for predicting unsteady, nonlinear hydrodynamic forces on the underwater quadruped robot we constructed. Trained on experimental data from leg force and body drag tests conducted in both a recirculating water tank and a towing tank, FED-LSTM outperforms traditional Empirical Formulas (EF) commonly used for flow prediction over flat surfaces. The model demonstrates superior accuracy and adaptability in capturing complex fluid dynamics, particularly in straight-line and turning-gait optimizations via the NSGA-II algorithm. FED-LSTM reduces deflection errors during straight-line swimming and improves turn times without increasing the turning radius. Hardware experiments further validate the model's precision and stability over EF. This approach provides a robust framework for enhancing the swimming performance of legged robots, laying the groundwork for future advances in underwater robotic locomotion.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03146.pdf,"Fei Han, Pengming Guo, Hao Chen, Weikun Li, Jingbo Ren, Naijun Liu, Ning Yang, Dixia Fan",cs.RO
Towards Effective Identification of Attack Techniques in Cyber Threat Intelligence Reports using Large Language Models,"This work evaluates the performance of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) extraction methods in identifying attack techniques from threat reports available on the web using the MITRE ATT&CK framework. We analyse four configurations utilising state-of-the-art tools, including the Threat Report ATT&CK Mapper (TRAM) and open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama2. Our findings reveal significant challenges, including class imbalance, overfitting, and domain-specific complexity, which impede accurate technique extraction. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel two-step pipeline: first, an LLM summarises the reports, and second, a retrained SciBERT model processes a rebalanced dataset augmented with LLM-generated data. This approach achieves an improvement in F1-scores compared to baseline models, with several attack techniques surpassing an F1-score of 0.90.

Motion-compensated cardiac MRI using low-rank diffeomorphic flow (DMoCo),"We introduce an unsupervised motion-compensated image reconstruction algorithm for free-breathing and ungated 3D cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We express the image volume corresponding to each specific motion phase as the deformation of a single static image template. The main contribution of the work is the low-rank model for the compact joint representation of the family of diffeomorphisms, parameterized by the motion phases. The diffeomorphism at a specific motion phase is obtained by integrating a parametric velocity field along a path connecting the reference template phase to the motion phase. The velocity field at different phases is represented using a low-rank model. The static template and the low-rank motion model parameters are learned directly from the k-space data in an unsupervised fashion. The more constrained motion model is observed to offer improved recovery compared to current motion-resolved and motion-compensated algorithms for free-breathing 3D cine MRI.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03149.pdf,"Joseph William Kettelkamp, Ludovica Romanin, Sarv Priya, Mathews Jacob",cs.CV
Robust Fairness Vision-Language Learning for Medical Image Analysis,"The advent of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medical image analysis has the potential to help process multimodal inputs and increase performance over traditional inference methods. However, when considering the domain in which these models will be implemented, fairness and robustness are important to ensure the model stays true for any patient. In this paper, we introduce a framework for ensuring robustness and fairness of VLM models. This framework modifies the loss function at training by identifying and adjusting faulty image-text pairs through a Dynamic Bad Pair Mining algorithm and also utilizing Sinkhorn distance to ensure the loss distributions of protected groups do not deviate from the total loss. Experimental testing of our framework shows up to a 8.6\% improvement when looking at equity-scaled AUC.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03153.pdf,"Sparsh Bansal, Mingyang Wu, Xin Wang, Shu Hu",cs.CV
StableMotion: Training Motion Cleanup Models with Unpaired Corrupted Data,"Motion capture (mocap) data often exhibits visually jarring artifacts due to inaccurate sensors and post-processing. Cleaning this corrupted data can require substantial manual effort from human experts, which can be a costly and time-consuming process. Previous data-driven motion cleanup methods offer the promise of automating this cleanup process, but often require in-domain paired corrupted-to-clean training data. Constructing such paired datasets requires access to high-quality, relatively artifact-free motion clips, which often necessitates laborious manual cleanup. In this work, we present StableMotion, a simple yet effective method for training motion cleanup models directly from unpaired corrupted datasets that need cleanup. The core component of our method is the introduction of motion quality indicators, which can be easily annotated through manual labeling or heuristic algorithms and enable training of quality-aware motion generation models on raw motion data with mixed quality. At test time, the model can be prompted to generate high-quality motions using the quality indicators. Our method can be implemented through a simple diffusion-based framework, leading to a unified motion generate-discriminate model, which can be used to both identify and fix corrupted frames. We demonstrate that our proposed method is effective for training motion cleanup models on raw mocap data in production scenarios by applying StableMotion to SoccerMocap, a 245-hour soccer mocap dataset containing real-world motion artifacts. The trained model effectively corrects a wide range of motion artifacts, reducing motion pops and frozen frames by 68% and 81%, respectively.

Rethinking the Global Convergence of Softmax Policy Gradient with Linear Function Approximation,"Policy gradient (PG) methods have played an essential role in the empirical successes of reinforcement learning. In order to handle large state-action spaces, PG methods are typically used with function approximation. In this setting, the approximation error in modeling problem-dependent quantities is a key notion for characterizing the global convergence of PG methods. We focus on Softmax PG with linear function approximation (referred to as $\texttt{Lin-SPG}$) and demonstrate that the approximation error is irrelevant to the algorithm's global convergence even for the stochastic bandit setting. Consequently, we first identify the necessary and sufficient conditions on the feature representation that can guarantee the asymptotic global convergence of $\texttt{Lin-SPG}$. Under these feature conditions, we prove that $T$ iterations of $\texttt{Lin-SPG}$ with a problem-specific learning rate result in an $O(1/T)$ convergence to the optimal policy. Furthermore, we prove that $\texttt{Lin-SPG}$ with any arbitrary constant learning rate can ensure asymptotic global convergence to the optimal policy.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03155.pdf,"Max Qiushi Lin, Jincheng Mei, Matin Aghaei, Michael Lu, Bo Dai, Alekh Agarwal, Dale Schuurmans, Csaba Szepesvari, Sharan Vaswani",cs.LG
Soft Best-of-n Sampling for Model Alignment,"Best-of-$n$ (BoN) sampling is a practical approach for aligning language model outputs with human preferences without expensive fine-tuning. BoN sampling is performed by generating $n$ responses to a prompt and then selecting the sample that maximizes a reward function. BoN yields high reward values in practice at a distortion cost, as measured by the KL-divergence between the sampled and original distribution. This distortion is coarsely controlled by varying the number of samples: larger $n$ yields a higher reward at a higher distortion cost. We introduce Soft Best-of-$n$ sampling, a generalization of BoN that allows for smooth interpolation between the original distribution and reward-maximizing distribution through a temperature parameter $\lambda$. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that Soft Best-of-$n$ sampling converges sharply to the optimal tilted distribution at a rate of $O(1/n)$ in KL and the expected (relative) reward. For sequences of discrete outputs, we analyze an additive reward model that reveals the fundamental limitations of blockwise sampling.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03156.pdf,"Claudio Mayrink Verdun, Alex Oesterling, Himabindu Lakkaraju, Flavio P.

Systematic Evaluation of Initial States and Exploration-Exploitation Strategies in PID Auto-Tuning: A Framework-Driven Approach Applied on Mobile Robots,"PID controllers are widely used in control systems because of their simplicity and effectiveness. Although advanced optimization techniques such as Bayesian Optimization and Differential Evolution have been applied to address the challenges of automatic tuning of PID controllers, the influence of initial system states on convergence and the balance between exploration and exploitation remains underexplored. Moreover, experimenting the influence directly on real cyber-physical systems such as mobile robots is crucial for deriving realistic insights. In the present paper, a novel framework is introduced to evaluate the impact of systematically varying these factors on the PID auto-tuning processes that utilize Bayesian Optimization and Differential Evolution. Testing was conducted on two distinct PID-controlled robotic platforms, an omnidirectional robot and a differential drive mobile robot, to assess the effects on convergence rate, settling time, rise time, and overshoot percentage. As a result, the experimental outcomes yield evidence on the effects of the systematic variations, thereby providing an empirical basis for future research studies in the field.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03159.pdf,"Zaid Ghazal, Ali Al-Bustami, Khouloud Gaaloul, Jaerock Kwon",cs.RO
An LLM-based Self-Evolving Security Framework for 6G Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks,"Recently emerged 6G space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs), which integrate satellites, aerial networks, and terrestrial communications, offer ubiquitous coverage for various mobile applications. However, the highly dynamic, open, and heterogeneous nature of SAGINs poses severe security issues. Forming a defense line of SAGINs suffers from two preliminary challenges: 1) accurately understanding massive unstructured multi-dimensional threat information to generate defense strategies against various malicious attacks, 2) rapidly adapting to potential unknown threats to yield more effective security strategies. To tackle the above two challenges, we propose a novel security framework for SAGINs based on Large Language Models (LLMs), which consists of two key ingredients LLM-6GNG and 6G-INST. Our proposed LLM-6GNG leverages refined chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and dynamic multi-agent mechanisms to analyze massive unstructured multi-dimensional threat data and generate comprehensive security strategies, thus addressing the first challenge. Our proposed 6G-INST relies on a novel self-evolving method to automatically update LLM-6GNG, enabling it to accommodate unknown threats under dynamic communication environments, thereby addressing the second challenge. Additionally, we prototype the proposed framework with ns-3, OpenAirInterface (OAI), and software-defined radio (SDR). Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. The results show that our framework produces highly accurate security strategies that remain robust against a variety of unknown attacks.

The Impact of Large Language Models on K-12 Education in Rural India: A Thematic Analysis of Student Volunteer's Perspectives,"AI-driven education, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to address learning disparities in rural K-12 schools. However, research on AI adoption in rural India remains limited, with existing studies focusing primarily on urban settings. This study examines the perceptions of volunteer teachers on AI integration in rural education, identifying key challenges and opportunities. Through semi-structured interviews with 23 volunteer educators in Rajasthan and Delhi, we conducted a thematic analysis to explore infrastructure constraints, teacher preparedness, and digital literacy gaps. Findings indicate that while LLMs could enhance personalized learning and reduce teacher workload, barriers such as poor connectivity, lack of AI training, and parental skepticism hinder adoption. Despite concerns over over-reliance and ethical risks, volunteers emphasize that AI should be seen as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for traditional teaching. Given the potential benefits, LLM-based tutors merit further exploration in rural classrooms, with structured implementation and localized adaptations to ensure accessibility and equity.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03163.pdf,"Harshita Goyal, Garima Garg, Prisha Mordia, Veena Ramachandran, Dhruv Kumar, Jagat Sesh Challa",cs.CY
InfoVids: Reimagining the Viewer Experience with Alternative Visualization-Presenter Relationships,"Traditional data presentations typically separate the presenter and visualization into two separate spaces--the 3D world and a 2D screen--enforcing visualization-centric stories. To create a more human-centric viewing experience, we establish a more equitable relationship between the visualization and the presenter through our InfoVids. These infographics-inspired informational videos are crafted to redefine relationships between the presenter and visualizations. As we design InfoVids, we explore how the use of layout, form, and interactions affects the viewer experience. We compare InfoVids against their baseline 2D `slides' equivalents across 9 metrics with 30 participants and provide practical, long-term insights from an autobiographical perspective. Our mixed methods analyses reveal that this paradigm reduced viewer attention splitting, shifted the focus from the visualization to the presenter, and led to more interactive, natural, and engaging full-body data performances for viewers. Ultimately, InfoVids helped viewers re-imagine traditional dynamics between the presenter and visualizations.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03164.pdf,"Ji Won Chung, Tongyu Zhou, Ivy Chen, Kevin Hsu, Ryan A.

Improving the Reproducibility of Deep Learning Software: An Initial Investigation through a Case Study Analysis,"The field of deep learning has witnessed significant breakthroughs, spanning various applications, and fundamentally transforming current software capabilities. However, alongside these advancements, there have been increasing concerns about reproducing the results of these deep learning methods. This is significant because reproducibility is the foundation of reliability and validity in software development, particularly in the rapidly evolving domain of deep learning. The difficulty of reproducibility may arise due to several reasons, including having differences from the original execution environment, incompatible software libraries, proprietary data and source code, lack of transparency, and the stochastic nature in some software. A study conducted by the Nature journal reveals that more than 70% of researchers failed to reproduce other researchers experiments and over 50% failed to reproduce their own experiments. Irreproducibility of deep learning poses significant challenges for researchers and practitioners. To address these concerns, this paper presents a systematic approach at analyzing and improving the reproducibility of deep learning models by demonstrating these guidelines using a case study. We illustrate the patterns and anti-patterns involved with these guidelines for improving the reproducibility of deep learning models. These guidelines encompass establishing a methodology to replicate the original software environment, implementing end-to-end training and testing algorithms, disclosing architectural designs, and enhancing transparency in data processing and training pipelines. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis to understand the model performance across diverse conditions. By implementing these strategies, we aim to bridge the gap between research and practice, so that innovations in deep learning can be effectively reproduced and deployed within software.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03165.pdf,"Nikita Ravi, Abhinav Goel, James C.

CombiBench: Benchmarking LLM Capability for Combinatorial Mathematics,"Neurosymbolic approaches integrating large language models with formal reasoning have recently achieved human-level performance on mathematics competition problems in algebra, geometry and number theory. In comparison, combinatorics remains a challenging domain, characterized by a lack of appropriate benchmarks and theorem libraries. To address this gap, we introduce CombiBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 100 combinatorial problems, each formalized in Lean~4 and paired with its corresponding informal statement. The problem set covers a wide spectrum of difficulty levels, ranging from middle school to IMO and university level, and span over ten combinatorial topics. CombiBench is suitable for testing IMO solving capabilities since it includes all IMO combinatorial problems since 2000 (except IMO 2004 P3 as its statement contain an images). Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive and standardized evaluation framework, dubbed Fine-Eval (for $\textbf{F}$ill-in-the-blank $\textbf{in}$ L$\textbf{e}$an Evaluation), for formal mathematics. It accommodates not only proof-based problems but also, for the first time, the evaluation of fill-in-the-blank questions. Using Fine-Eval as the evaluation method and Kimina Lean Server as the backend, we benchmark several LLMs on CombiBench and observe that their capabilities for formally solving combinatorial problems remain limited. Among all models tested (none of which has been trained for this particular task), Kimina-Prover attains the best results, solving 7 problems (out of 100) under both ``with solution'' and ``without solution'' scenarios. We open source the benchmark dataset alongside with the code of the proposed evaluation method at https://github.com/MoonshotAI/CombiBench/.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03171.pdf,"Junqi Liu, Xiaohan Lin, Jonas Bayer, Yael Dillies, Weijie Jiang, Xiaodan Liang, Roman Soletskyi, Haiming Wang, Yunzhou Xie, Beibei Xiong, Zhengfeng Yang, Jujian Zhang, Lihong Zhi, Jia Li, Zhengying Liu",cs.AI
Null Counterfactual Factor Interactions for Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning,"Hindsight relabeling is a powerful tool for overcoming sparsity in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL), especially in certain domains such as navigation and locomotion. However, hindsight relabeling can struggle in object-centric domains. For example, suppose that the goal space consists of a robotic arm pushing a particular target block to a goal location. In this case, hindsight relabeling will give high rewards to any trajectory that does not interact with the block. However, these behaviors are only useful when the object is already at the goal -- an extremely rare case in practice. A dataset dominated by these kinds of trajectories can complicate learning and lead to failures. In object-centric domains, one key intuition is that meaningful trajectories are often characterized by object-object interactions such as pushing the block with the gripper. To leverage this intuition, we introduce Hindsight Relabeling using Interactions (HInt), which combines interactions with hindsight relabeling to improve the sample efficiency of downstream RL. However because interactions do not have a consensus statistical definition tractable for downstream GCRL, we propose a definition of interactions based on the concept of null counterfactual: a cause object is interacting with a target object if, in a world where the cause object did not exist, the target object would have different transition dynamics. We leverage this definition to infer interactions in Null Counterfactual Interaction Inference (NCII), which uses a ""nulling'' operation with a learned model to infer interactions. NCII is able to achieve significantly improved interaction inference accuracy in both simple linear dynamics domains and dynamic robotic domains in Robosuite, Robot Air Hockey, and Franka Kitchen and HInt improves sample efficiency by up to 4x.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03172.pdf,"Caleb Chuck, Fan Feng, Carl Qi, Chang Shi, Siddhant Agarwal, Amy Zhang, Scott Niekum",cs.LG
RAVU: Retrieval Augmented Video Understanding with Compositional Reasoning over Graph,"Comprehending long videos remains a significant challenge for Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs). Current LMMs struggle to process even minutes to hours videos due to their lack of explicit memory and retrieval mechanisms. To address this limitation, we propose RAVU (Retrieval Augmented Video Understanding), a novel framework for video understanding enhanced by retrieval with compositional reasoning over a spatio-temporal graph. We construct a graph representation of the video, capturing both spatial and temporal relationships between entities. This graph serves as a long-term memory, allowing us to track objects and their actions across time. To answer complex queries, we decompose the queries into a sequence of reasoning steps and execute these steps on the graph, retrieving relevant key information. Our approach enables more accurate understanding of long videos, particularly for queries that require multi-hop reasoning and tracking objects across frames. Our approach demonstrate superior performances with limited retrieved frames (5-10) compared with other SOTA methods and baselines on two major video QA datasets, NExT-QA and EgoSchema.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03173.pdf,"Sameer Malik, Moyuru Yamada, Ayush Singh, Dishank Aggarwal",cs.CV
Automated Data Curation Using GPS & NLP to Generate Instruction-Action Pairs for Autonomous Vehicle Vision-Language Navigation Datasets,"Instruction-Action (IA) data pairs are valuable for training robotic systems, especially autonomous vehicles (AVs), but having humans manually annotate this data is costly and time-inefficient. This paper explores the potential of using mobile application Global Positioning System (GPS) references and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automatically generate large volumes of IA commands and responses without having a human generate or retroactively tag the data. In our pilot data collection, by driving to various destinations and collecting voice instructions from GPS applications, we demonstrate a means to collect and categorize the diverse sets of instructions, further accompanied by video data to form complete vision-language-action triads. We provide details on our completely automated data collection prototype system, ADVLAT-Engine. We characterize collected GPS voice instructions into eight different classifications, highlighting the breadth of commands and referentialities available for curation from freely available mobile applications. Through research and exploration into the automation of IA data pairs using GPS references, the potential to increase the speed and volume at which high-quality IA datasets are created, while minimizing cost, can pave the way for robust vision-language-action (VLA) models to serve tasks in vision-language navigation (VLN) and human-interactive autonomous systems.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03174.pdf,"Guillermo Roque, Erika Maquiling, Jose Giovanni Tapia Lopez, Ross Greer",cs.RO
Multiuser Communications Aided by Cross-Linked Movable Antenna Array: Architecture and Optimization,"Movable antenna (MA) has been regarded as a promising technology to enhance wireless communication performance by enabling flexible antenna movement. However, the hardware cost of conventional MA systems scales with the number of movable elements due to the need for independently controllable driving components. To reduce hardware cost, we propose in this paper a novel architecture named cross-linked MA (CL-MA) array, which enables the collective movement of multiple antennas in both horizontal and vertical directions. To evaluate the performance benefits of the CL-MA array, we consider an uplink multiuser communication scenario. Specifically, we aim to minimize the total transmit power while satisfying a given minimum rate requirement for each user by jointly optimizing the horizontal and vertical antenna position vectors (APVs), the receive combining at the base station (BS), and the transmit power of users. A globally lower bound on the total transmit power is derived, with closed-form solutions for the APVs obtained under the condition of a single channel path for each user. For the more general case of multiple channel paths, we develop a low-complexity algorithm based on discrete antenna position optimization. Additionally, to further reduce antenna movement overhead, a statistical channel-based antenna position optimization approach is proposed, allowing for unchanged APVs over a long time period. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CL-MA schemes significantly outperform conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems and closely approach the theoretical lower bound on the total transmit power. Compared to the instantaneous channel-based CL-MA optimization, the statistical channel-based approach incurs a slight performance loss but achieves significantly lower movement overhead, making it an appealing solution for practical wireless systems.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03175.pdf,"Lipeng Zhu, He Sun, Wenyan Ma, Zhenyu Xiao, Rui Zhang",cs.IT
seq-JEPA: Autoregressive Predictive Learning of Invariant-Equivariant World Models,"Current self-supervised algorithms mostly rely on transformations such as data augmentation and masking to learn visual representations. This is achieved by inducing invariance or equivariance with respect to these transformations after encoding two views of an image. This dominant two-view paradigm can limit the flexibility of learned representations for downstream adaptation by creating performance trade-offs between invariance-related tasks such as image classification and more fine-grained equivariance-related tasks. In this work, we introduce \emph{seq-JEPA}, a world modeling paradigm based on joint-embedding predictive architecture that leverages architectural inductive biases to resolve this trade-off. Without requiring an additional equivariance predictor or loss term, seq-JEPA simultaneously learns two architecturally segregated representations: one equivariant to the specified transformations and another invariant to them and suited for tasks such as classification. To do so, our model processes a short sequence of different views (observations) of an input image. Each encoded view is concatenated with embeddings corresponding to the relative transformation (action) producing the next observation in the sequence. A transformer encoder outputs an aggregate representation of this sequence, which is subsequently conditioned on the action leading to the next observation to predict its representation. Empirically, seq-JEPA achieves strong performance on equivariant benchmarks and image classification without sacrificing one for the other. Additionally, our framework excels at tasks that inherently require aggregating a sequence of observations, such as path integration across actions and predictive learning across eye movements.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03176.pdf,"Hafez Ghaemi, Eilif Muller, Shahab Bakhtiari",cs.CV
RADE: Learning Risk-Adjustable Driving Environment via Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion,"Generating safety-critical scenarios in high-fidelity simulations offers a promising and cost-effective approach for efficient testing of autonomous vehicles. Existing methods typically rely on manipulating a single vehicle's trajectory through sophisticated designed objectives to induce adversarial interactions, often at the cost of realism and scalability. In this work, we propose the Risk-Adjustable Driving Environment (RADE), a simulation framework that generates statistically realistic and risk-adjustable traffic scenes. Built upon a multi-agent diffusion architecture, RADE jointly models the behavior of all agents in the environment and conditions their trajectories on a surrogate risk measure. Unlike traditional adversarial methods, RADE learns risk-conditioned behaviors directly from data, preserving naturalistic multi-agent interactions with controllable risk levels. To ensure physical plausibility, we incorporate a tokenized dynamics check module that efficiently filters generated trajectories using a motion vocabulary. We validate RADE on the real-world rounD dataset, demonstrating that it preserves statistical realism across varying risk levels and naturally increases the likelihood of safety-critical events as the desired risk level grows up. Our results highlight RADE's potential as a scalable and realistic tool for AV safety evaluation.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03178.pdf,"Jiawei Wang, Xintao Yan, Yao Mu, Haowei Sun, Zhong Cao, Henry X.

Bridging Expertise Gaps: The Role of LLMs in Human-AI Collaboration for Cybersecurity,"This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can function as intelligent collaborators to bridge expertise gaps in cybersecurity decision-making. We examine two representative tasks-phishing email detection and intrusion detection-that differ in data modality, cognitive complexity, and user familiarity. Through a controlled mixed-methods user study, n = 58 (phishing, n = 34; intrusion, n = 24), we find that human-AI collaboration improves task performance,reducing false positives in phishing detection and false negatives in intrusion detection. A learning effect is also observed when participants transition from collaboration to independent work, suggesting that LLMs can support long-term skill development. Our qualitative analysis shows that interaction dynamics-such as LLM definitiveness, explanation style, and tone-influence user trust, prompting strategies, and decision revision. Users engaged in more analytic questioning and showed greater reliance on LLM feedback in high-complexity settings. These results provide design guidance for building interpretable, adaptive, and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems, and demonstrate that LLMs can meaningfully support non-experts in reasoning through complex cybersecurity problems.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03179.pdf,"Shahroz Tariq, Ronal Singh, Mohan Baruwal Chhetri, Surya Nepal, Cecile Paris",cs.CR
VLM Q-Learning: Aligning Vision-Language Models for Interactive Decision-Making,"Recent research looks to harness the general knowledge and reasoning of large language models (LLMs) into agents that accomplish user-specified goals in interactive environments. Vision-language models (VLMs) extend LLMs to multi-modal data and provide agents with the visual reasoning necessary for new applications in areas such as computer automation. However, agent tasks emphasize skills where accessible open-weight VLMs lag behind their LLM equivalents. For example, VLMs are less capable of following an environment's strict output syntax requirements and are more focused on open-ended question answering. Overcoming these limitations requires supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on task-specific expert demonstrations. Our work approaches these challenges from an offline-to-online reinforcement learning (RL) perspective. RL lets us fine-tune VLMs to agent tasks while learning from the unsuccessful decisions of our own model or more capable (larger) models. We explore an off-policy RL solution that retains the stability and simplicity of the widely used SFT workflow while allowing our agent to self-improve and learn from low-quality datasets. We demonstrate this technique with two open-weight VLMs across three multi-modal agent domains.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03181.pdf,"Jake Grigsby, Yuke Zhu, Michael Ryoo, Juan Carlos Niebles",cs.LG
Interactive Instance Annotation with Siamese Networks,"Annotating instance masks is time-consuming and labor-intensive. A promising solution is to predict contours using a deep learning model and then allow users to refine them. However, most existing methods focus on in-domain scenarios, limiting their effectiveness for cross-domain annotation tasks. In this paper, we propose SiamAnno, a framework inspired by the use of Siamese networks in object tracking. SiamAnno leverages one-shot learning to annotate previously unseen objects by taking a bounding box as input and predicting object boundaries, which can then be adjusted by annotators. Trained on one dataset and tested on another without fine-tuning, SiamAnno achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets, demonstrating its ability to handle domain and environment shifts in cross-domain tasks. We also provide more comprehensive results compared to previous work, establishing a strong baseline for future research. To our knowledge, SiamAnno is the first model to explore Siamese architecture for instance annotation.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03184.pdf,"Xiang Xu, Ruotong Li, Mengjun Yi, Baile XU, Furao Shen, Jian Zhao",cs.CV
Behavioral Sensing and Intervention Paradigm: A Review of Closed-Loop Approaches for Ingestion Health,"Ingestive behavior plays a critical role in health, yet many existing interventions remain limited to static guidance or manual self-tracking. With the increasing integration of sensors and perceptual computing, recent systems have begun to support closed-loop interventions that dynamically sense user behavior and provide feedback during or around ingestion episodes. In this survey, we review 136 studies that leverage sensor-enabled or interaction-mediated approaches to influence eating behavior. We propose a behavioral closed-loop paradigm comprising three core components: target behaviors, sensing modalities, and feedback strategies. A taxonomy of sensing and intervention modalities is presented, organized along human- and environment-based dimensions. Our analysis also examines evaluation methods and design trends across different modality-behavior pairings. This review reveals prevailing patterns and critical gaps, offering design insights for future adaptive and context-aware ingestion health interventions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03185.pdf,"Jun Fang, Yanuo Zhou, Ka I Chan, Jiajin Li, Zeyi Sun, Zhengnan Li, Zicong Fu, Hongjing Piao, Haodong Xu, Yuanchun Shi, Yuntao Wang",cs.HC
CoGenAV: Versatile Audio-Visual Representation Learning via Contrastive-Generative Synchronization,"The inherent synchronization between a speaker's lip movements, voice, and the underlying linguistic content offers a rich source of information for improving speech processing tasks, especially in challenging conditions where traditional audio-only systems falter. We introduce CoGenAV, a powerful and data-efficient model designed to learn versatile audio-visual representations applicable across a wide range of speech and audio-visual tasks. CoGenAV is trained by optimizing a dual objective derived from natural audio-visual synchrony, contrastive feature alignment and generative text prediction, using only 223 hours of labeled data from the LRS2 dataset. This contrastive-generative synchronization strategy effectively captures fundamental cross-modal correlations. We showcase the effectiveness and versatility of the learned CoGenAV representations on multiple benchmarks. When utilized for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) on LRS2, these representations contribute to achieving a state-of-the-art Word Error Rate (WER) of 1.27. They also enable strong performance in Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) with a WER of 22.0 on LRS2, and significantly improve performance in noisy environments by over 70%. Furthermore, CoGenAV representations benefit speech reconstruction tasks, boosting performance in Speech Enhancement and Separation, and achieve competitive results in audio-visual synchronization tasks like Active Speaker Detection (ASD). Our model will be open-sourced to facilitate further development and collaboration within both academia and industry.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03186.pdf,"Detao Bai, Zhiheng Ma, Xihan Wei, Liefeng Bo",cs.SD
Transformers Applied to Short-term Solar PV Power Output Forecasting,"Reliable forecasts of the power output from variable renewable energy generators like solar photovoltaic systems are important to balancing load on real-time electricity markets and ensuring electricity supply reliability. However, solar PV power output is highly uncertain, with significant variations occurring over both longer (daily or seasonally) and shorter (within minutes) timescales due to weather conditions, especially cloud cover. This paper builds on existing work that uses convolutional neural networks in the computer vision task of predicting (in a Nowcast model) and forecasting (in a Forecast model) solar PV power output (Stanford EAO SUNSET Model). A pure transformer architecture followed by a fully-connected layer is applied to one year of image data with experiments run on various combinations of learning rate and batch size. We find that the transformer architecture performs almost as well as the baseline model in the PV output prediction task. However, it performs worse on sunny days.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03188.pdf,"Andea Scott, Sindhu Sreedhara, Folasade Ayoola",cs.CE
Patterns and Mechanisms of Contrastive Activation Engineering,"Controlling the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge due to their inherent complexity and opacity. While techniques like fine-tuning can modify model behavior, they typically require extensive computational resources. Recent work has introduced a class of contrastive activation engineering (CAE) techniques as promising approaches for steering LLM outputs through targeted modifications to their internal representations. Applied at inference-time with zero cost, CAE has the potential to introduce a new paradigm of flexible, task-specific LLM behavior tuning. We analyze the performance of CAE in in-distribution, out-of-distribution settings, evaluate drawbacks, and begin to develop comprehensive guidelines for its effective deployment. We find that 1. CAE is only reliably effective when applied to in-distribution contexts. 2. Increasing the number of samples used to generate steering vectors has diminishing returns at around 80 samples. 3. Steering vectors are susceptible to adversarial inputs that reverses the behavior that is steered for. 4. Steering vectors harm the overall model perplexity. 5. Larger models are more resistant to steering-induced degradation.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03189.pdf,"Yixiong Hao, Ayush Panda, Stepan Shabalin, Sheikh Abdur Raheem Ali",cs.AI
A study on audio synchronous steganography detection and distributed guide inference model based on sliding spectral features and intelligent inference drive,"With the rise of short video platforms in global communication, embedding steganographic data in audio synchronization streams has emerged as a new covert communication method. To address the limitations of traditional techniques in detecting synchronized steganography, this paper proposes a detection and distributed guidance reconstruction model based on short video ""Yupan"" samples released by China's South Sea Fleet on TikTok. The method integrates sliding spectrum feature extraction and intelligent inference mechanisms. A 25 ms sliding window with short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is used to extract the main frequency trajectory and construct the synchronization frame detection model (M1), identifying a frame flag ""FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF80"". The subsequent 32-byte payload is decoded by a structured model (M2) to infer distributed guidance commands. Analysis reveals a low-entropy, repetitive byte sequence in the 36 to 45 second audio segment with highly concentrated spectral energy, confirming the presence of synchronization frames. Although plaintext semantics are not restored, the consistency in command field layout suggests features of military communication protocols. The multi-segment splicing model further shows cross-video embedding and centralized decoding capabilities. The proposed framework validates the effectiveness of sliding spectral features for synchronized steganography detection and builds an extensible inference model for covert communication analysis and tactical guidance simulation on open platforms.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03193.pdf,Wei Meng,cs.SD
Convergence Of Consistency Model With Multistep Sampling Under General Data Assumptions,"Diffusion models accomplish remarkable success in data generation tasks across various domains. However, the iterative sampling process is computationally expensive. Consistency models are proposed to learn consistency functions to map from noise to data directly, which allows one-step fast data generation and multistep sampling to improve sample quality. In this paper, we study the convergence of consistency models when the self-consistency property holds approximately under the training distribution. Our analysis requires only mild data assumption and applies to a family of forward processes. When the target data distribution has bounded support or has tails that decay sufficiently fast, we show that the samples generated by the consistency model are close to the target distribution in Wasserstein distance; when the target distribution satisfies some smoothness assumption, we show that with an additional perturbation step for smoothing, the generated samples are close to the target distribution in total variation distance. We provide two case studies with commonly chosen forward processes to demonstrate the benefit of multistep sampling.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03194.pdf,"Yiding Chen, Yiyi Zhang, Owen Oertell, Wen Sun",cs.LG
QiMeng-CPU-v2: Automated Superscalar Processor Design by Learning Data Dependencies,"Automated processor design, which can significantly reduce human efforts and accelerate design cycles, has received considerable attention. While recent advancements have automatically designed single-cycle processors that execute one instruction per cycle, their performance cannot compete with modern superscalar processors that execute multiple instructions per cycle. Previous methods fail on superscalar processor design because they cannot address inter-instruction data dependencies, leading to inefficient sequential instruction execution.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03195.pdf,"Shuyao Cheng, Rui Zhang, Wenkai He, Pengwei Jin, Chongxiao Li, Zidong Du, Xing Hu, Yifan Hao, Guanglin Xu, Yuanbo Wen, Ling Li, Qi Guo, Yunji Chen",cs.AR
"A Trustworthy Multi-LLM Network: Challenges,Solutions, and A Use Case","Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong potential across a variety of tasks in communications and networking due to their advanced reasoning capabilities. However, because different LLMs have different model structures and are trained using distinct corpora and methods, they may offer varying optimization strategies for the same network issues. Moreover, the limitations of an individual LLM's training data, aggravated by the potential maliciousness of its hosting device, can result in responses with low confidence or even bias. To address these challenges, we propose a blockchain-enabled collaborative framework that connects multiple LLMs into a Trustworthy Multi-LLM Network (MultiLLMN). This architecture enables the cooperative evaluation and selection of the most reliable and high-quality responses to complex network optimization problems. Specifically, we begin by reviewing related work and highlighting the limitations of existing LLMs in collaboration and trust, emphasizing the need for trustworthiness in LLM-based systems. We then introduce the workflow and design of the proposed Trustworthy MultiLLMN framework. Given the severity of False Base Station (FBS) attacks in B5G and 6G communication systems and the difficulty of addressing such threats through traditional modeling techniques, we present FBS defense as a case study to empirically validate the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we outline promising future research directions in this emerging area.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03196.pdf,"Haoxiang Luo, Gang Sun, Yinqiu Liu, Dusit Niyato, Hongfang Yu, Mohammed Atiquzzaman, Schahram Dustdar",cs.NI
PiCo: Enhancing Text-Image Alignment with Improved Noise Selection and Precise Mask Control in Diffusion Models,"Advanced diffusion models have made notable progress in text-to-image compositional generation. However, it is still a challenge for existing models to achieve text-image alignment when confronted with complex text prompts. In this work, we highlight two factors that affect this alignment: the quality of the randomly initialized noise and the reliability of the generated controlling mask. We then propose PiCo (Pick-and-Control), a novel training-free approach with two key components to tackle these two factors. First, we develop a noise selection module to assess the quality of the random noise and determine whether the noise is suitable for the target text. A fast sampling strategy is utilized to ensure efficiency in the noise selection stage. Second, we introduce a referring mask module to generate pixel-level masks and to precisely modulate the cross-attention maps. The referring mask is applied to the standard diffusion process to guide the reasonable interaction between text and image features. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of PiCo in liberating users from the tedious process of random generation and in enhancing the text-image alignment for diverse text descriptions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03203.pdf,"Chang Xie, Chenyi Zhuang, Pan Gao",cs.CV

Transformers for Learning on Noisy and Task-Level Manifolds: Approximation and Generalization Insights,"Transformers serve as the foundational architecture for large language and video generation models, such as GPT, BERT, SORA and their successors. Empirical studies have demonstrated that real-world data and learning tasks exhibit low-dimensional structures, along with some noise or measurement error. The performance of transformers tends to depend on the intrinsic dimension of the data/tasks, though theoretical understandings remain largely unexplored for transformers. This work establishes a theoretical foundation by analyzing the performance of transformers for regression tasks involving noisy input data on a manifold. Specifically, the input data are in a tubular neighborhood of a manifold, while the ground truth function depends on the projection of the noisy data onto the manifold. We prove approximation and generalization errors which crucially depend on the intrinsic dimension of the manifold. Our results demonstrate that transformers can leverage low-complexity structures in learning task even when the input data are perturbed by high-dimensional noise. Our novel proof technique constructs representations of basic arithmetic operations by transformers, which may hold independent interest.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03205.pdf,"Zhaiming Shen, Alex Havrilla, Rongjie Lai, Alexander Cloninger, Wenjing Liao",cs.LG
Partial Label Clustering,"Partial label learning (PLL) is a significant weakly supervised learning framework, where each training example corresponds to a set of candidate labels and only one label is the ground-truth label. For the first time, this paper investigates the partial label clustering problem, which takes advantage of the limited available partial labels to improve the clustering performance. Specifically, we first construct a weight matrix of examples based on their relationships in the feature space and disambiguate the candidate labels to estimate the ground-truth label based on the weight matrix. Then, we construct a set of must-link and cannot-link constraints based on the disambiguation results. Moreover, we propagate the initial must-link and cannot-link constraints based on an adversarial prior promoted dual-graph learning approach. Finally, we integrate weight matrix construction, label disambiguation, and pairwise constraints propagation into a joint model to achieve mutual enhancement. We also theoretically prove that a better disambiguated label matrix can help improve clustering performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method realizes superior performance when comparing with state-of-the-art constrained clustering methods, and outperforms PLL and semi-supervised PLL methods when only limited samples are annotated.

A Chaos Driven Metric for Backdoor Attack Detection,"The advancement and adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models across diverse domains have transformed the way we interact with technology. However, it is essential to recognize that while AI models have introduced remarkable advancements, they also present inherent challenges such as their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. The current work proposes a novel defense mechanism against one of the most significant attack vectors of AI models - the backdoor attack via data poisoning of training datasets. In this defense technique, an integrated approach that combines chaos theory with manifold learning is proposed. A novel metric - Precision Matrix Dependency Score (PDS) that is based on the conditional variance of Neurochaos features is formulated. The PDS metric has been successfully evaluated to distinguish poisoned samples from non-poisoned samples across diverse datasets.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03208.pdf,"Hema Karnam Surendrababu (School of Conflict and Security Studies, National Institute of Advanced Studies, Indian Institute of Science Campus, Bengaluru), Nithin Nagaraj (Complex Systems Programme, National Institute of Advanced Studies, Indian Institute of Science Campus, Bengaluru)",cs.CR
DYSTIL: Dynamic Strategy Induction with Large Language Models for Reinforcement Learning,"Reinforcement learning from expert demonstrations has long remained a challenging research problem, and existing state-of-the-art methods using behavioral cloning plus further RL training often suffer from poor generalization, low sample efficiency, and poor model interpretability. Inspired by the strong reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), we propose a novel strategy-based reinforcement learning framework integrated with LLMs called DYnamic STrategy Induction with Llms for reinforcement learning (DYSTIL) to overcome these limitations. DYSTIL dynamically queries a strategy-generating LLM to induce textual strategies based on advantage estimations and expert demonstrations, and gradually internalizes induced strategies into the RL agent through policy optimization to improve its performance through boosting policy generalization and enhancing sample efficiency. It also provides a direct textual channel to observe and interpret the evolution of the policy's underlying strategies during training. We test DYSTIL over challenging RL environments from Minigrid and BabyAI, and empirically demonstrate that DYSTIL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods by 17.75% in average success rate while also enjoying higher sample efficiency during the learning process.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03209.pdf,"Borui Wang, Kathleen McKeown, Rex Ying",cs.LG
Elastic Index Select for Label-Hybrid Search in Vector Database,"Real-world vector embeddings are usually associated with extra labels, such as attributes and keywords. Many applications require the nearest neighbor search that contains specific labels, such as searching for product image embeddings restricted to a particular brand. A straightforward approach is to materialize all possible indices according to the complete query label workload. However, this leads to an exponential increase in both index space and processing time, which significantly limits scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we leverage the inclusion relationships among query label sets to construct partial indexes, enabling index sharing across queries for improved construction efficiency. We introduce \textit{elastic factor} bounds to guarantee search performance and use the greedy algorithm to select indices that meet the bounds, achieving a tradeoff between efficiency and space. Meanwhile, we also designed the algorithm to achieve the best elastic factor under a given space limitation. Experimental results on multiple real datasets demonstrate that our algorithm can achieve near-optimal search performance, achieving up to 10x-500x search efficiency speed up over state-of-the-art approaches. Our algorithm is highly versatile, since it is not constrained by index type and can seamlessly integrate with existing optimized libraries.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03212.pdf,"Mingyu Yang, Wenxuan Xia, Wentao Li, Raymond Chi-Wing Wong, Wei Wang",cs.DB
DocSpiral: A Platform for Integrated Assistive Document Annotation through Human-in-the-Spiral,"Acquiring structured data from domain-specific, image-based documents such as scanned reports is crucial for many downstream tasks but remains challenging due to document variability. Many of these documents exist as images rather than as machine-readable text, which requires human annotation to train automated extraction systems. We present DocSpiral, the first Human-in-the-Spiral assistive document annotation platform, designed to address the challenge of extracting structured information from domain-specific, image-based document collections. Our spiral design establishes an iterative cycle in which human annotations train models that progressively require less manual intervention. DocSpiral integrates document format normalization, comprehensive annotation interfaces, evaluation metrics dashboard, and API endpoints for the development of AI / ML models into a unified workflow. Experiments demonstrate that our framework reduces annotation time by at least 41\% while showing consistent performance gains across three iterations during model training.

Accelerating Evolution: Integrating PSO Principles into Real-Coded Genetic Algorithm Crossover,"This study introduces an innovative crossover operator named Particle Swarm Optimization-inspired Crossover (PSOX), which is specifically developed for real-coded genetic algorithms. Departing from conventional crossover approaches that only exchange information between individuals within the same generation, PSOX uniquely incorporates guidance from both the current global best solution and historical optimal solutions across multiple generations. This novel mechanism enables the algorithm to maintain population diversity while simultaneously accelerating convergence toward promising regions of the search space. The effectiveness of PSOX is rigorously evaluated through comprehensive experiments on 15 benchmark test functions with diverse characteristics, including unimodal, multimodal, and highly complex landscapes. Comparative analysis against five state-of-the-art crossover operators reveals that PSOX consistently delivers superior performance in terms of solution accuracy, algorithmic stability, and convergence speed, especially when combined with an appropriate mutation strategy. Furthermore, the study provides an in-depth investigation of how different mutation rates influence PSOX's performance, yielding practical guidelines for parameter tuning when addressing optimization problems with varying landscape properties.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03217.pdf,"Xiaobo Jin, JiaShu Tu",cs.NE
Dual-Domain Masked Image Modeling: A Self-Supervised Pretraining Strategy Using Spatial and Frequency Domain Masking for Hyperspectral Data,"Hyperspectral images (HSIs) capture rich spectral signatures that reveal vital material properties, offering broad applicability across various domains. However, the scarcity of labeled HSI data limits the full potential of deep learning, especially for transformer-based architectures that require large-scale training. To address this constraint, we propose Spatial-Frequency Masked Image Modeling (SFMIM), a self-supervised pretraining strategy for hyperspectral data that utilizes the large portion of unlabeled data. Our method introduces a novel dual-domain masking mechanism that operates in both spatial and frequency domains. The input HSI cube is initially divided into non-overlapping patches along the spatial dimension, with each patch comprising the entire spectrum of its corresponding spatial location. In spatial masking, we randomly mask selected patches and train the model to reconstruct the masked inputs using the visible patches. Concurrently, in frequency masking, we remove portions of the frequency components of the input spectra and predict the missing frequencies. By learning to reconstruct these masked components, the transformer-based encoder captures higher-order spectral-spatial correlations. We evaluate our approach on three publicly available HSI classification benchmarks and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our model shows rapid convergence during fine-tuning, highlighting the efficiency of our pretraining strategy.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03220.pdf,"Shaheer Mohamed, Tharindu Fernando, Sridha Sridharan, Peyman Moghadam, Clinton Fookes",cs.CV
MGFF-TDNN: A Multi-Granularity Feature Fusion TDNN Model with Depth-Wise Separable Module for Speaker Verification,"In speaker verification, traditional models often emphasize modeling long-term contextual features to capture global speaker characteristics. However, this approach can neglect fine-grained voiceprint information, which contains highly discriminative features essential for robust speaker embeddings. This paper introduces a novel model architecture, termed MGFF-TDNN, based on multi-granularity feature fusion. The MGFF-TDNN leverages a two-dimensional depth-wise separable convolution module, enhanced with local feature modeling, as a front-end feature extractor to effectively capture time-frequency domain features. To achieve comprehensive multi-granularity feature fusion, we propose the M-TDNN structure, which integrates global contextual modeling with fine-grained feature extraction by combining time-delay neural networks and phoneme-level feature pooling. Experiments on the VoxCeleb dataset demonstrate that the MGFF-TDNN achieves outstanding performance in speaker verification while remaining efficient in terms of parameters and computational resources.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03228.pdf,"Ya Li, Bin Zhou, Bo Hu",cs.SD

Joint Resource Management for Energy-efficient UAV-assisted SWIPT-MEC: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,"The integration of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) technology in 6G Internet of Things (IoT) networks faces significant challenges in remote areas and disaster scenarios where ground infrastructure is unavailable. This paper proposes a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) system enhanced by directional antennas to provide both computational resources and energy support for ground IoT terminals. However, such systems require multiple trade-off policies to balance UAV energy consumption, terminal battery levels, and computational resource allocation under various constraints, including limited UAV battery capacity, non-linear energy harvesting characteristics, and dynamic task arrivals. To address these challenges comprehensively, we formulate a bi-objective optimization problem that simultaneously considers system energy efficiency and terminal battery sustainability. We then reformulate this non-convex problem with a hybrid solution space as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose an improved soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm with an action simplification mechanism to enhance its convergence and generalization capabilities. Simulation results have demonstrated that our proposed approach outperforms various baselines in different scenarios, achieving efficient energy management while maintaining high computational performance.

GraspVLA: a Grasping Foundation Model Pre-trained on Billion-scale Synthetic Action Data,"Embodied foundation models are gaining increasing attention for their zero-shot generalization, scalability, and adaptability to new tasks through few-shot post-training. However, existing models rely heavily on real-world data, which is costly and labor-intensive to collect. Synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative, yet its potential remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we explore the feasibility of training Vision-Language-Action models entirely with large-scale synthetic action data. We curate SynGrasp-1B, a billion-frame robotic grasping dataset generated in simulation with photorealistic rendering and extensive domain randomization. Building on this, we present GraspVLA, a VLA model pretrained on large-scale synthetic action data as a foundational model for grasping tasks. GraspVLA integrates autoregressive perception tasks and flow-matching-based action generation into a unified Chain-of-Thought process, enabling joint training on synthetic action data and Internet semantics data. This design helps mitigate sim-to-real gaps and facilitates the transfer of learned actions to a broader range of Internet-covered objects, achieving open-vocabulary generalization in grasping. Extensive evaluations across real-world and simulation benchmarks demonstrate GraspVLA's advanced zero-shot generalizability and few-shot adaptability to specific human preferences.

A theoretical result justifying the use of well-balanced Full-Order Models (FOMs) is presented. Numerical experiments validate the approach, demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency.

RobotxR1: Enabling Embodied Robotic Intelligence on Large Language Models through Closed-Loop Reinforcement Learning,"Future robotic systems operating in real-world environments will require on-board embodied intelligence without continuous cloud connection, balancing capabilities with constraints on computational power and memory. This work presents an extension of the R1-zero approach, which enables the usage of low parameter-count Large Language Models (LLMs) in the robotic domain. The R1-Zero approach was originally developed to enable mathematical reasoning in LLMs using static datasets. We extend it to the robotics domain through integration in a closed-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. This extension enhances reasoning in Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) settings without relying solely on distillation of large models through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We show that small-scale LLMs can achieve effective reasoning performance by learning through closed-loop interaction with their environment, which enables tasks that previously required significantly larger models. In an autonomous driving setting, a performance gain of 20.2%-points over the SFT-based baseline is observed with a Qwen2.5-1.5B model. Using the proposed training procedure, Qwen2.5-3B achieves a 63.3% control adaptability score, surpassing the 58.5% obtained by the much larger, cloud-bound GPT-4o. These results highlight that practical, on-board deployment of small LLMs is not only feasible but can outperform larger models if trained through environmental feedback, underscoring the importance of an interactive learning framework for robotic Embodied AI, one grounded in practical experience rather than static supervision.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03238.pdf,"Liam Boyle, Nicolas Baumann, Paviththiren Sivasothilingam, Michele Magno, Luca Benini",cs.RO
Seeing the Abstract: Translating the Abstract Language for Vision Language Models,"Natural language goes beyond dryly describing visual content. It contains rich abstract concepts to express feeling, creativity and properties that cannot be directly perceived. Yet, current research in Vision Language Models (VLMs) has not shed light on abstract-oriented language. Our research breaks new ground by uncovering its wide presence and under-estimated value, with extensive analysis. Particularly, we focus our investigation on the fashion domain, a highly-representative field with abstract expressions. By analyzing recent large-scale multimodal fashion datasets, we find that abstract terms have a dominant presence, rivaling the concrete ones, providing novel information, and being useful in the retrieval task. However, a critical challenge emerges: current general-purpose or fashion-specific VLMs are pre-trained with databases that lack sufficient abstract words in their text corpora, thus hindering their ability to effectively represent abstract-oriented language. We propose a training-free and model-agnostic method, Abstract-to-Concrete Translator (ACT), to shift abstract representations towards well-represented concrete ones in the VLM latent space, using pre-trained models and existing multimodal databases. On the text-to-image retrieval task, despite being training-free, ACT outperforms the fine-tuned VLMs in both same- and cross-dataset settings, exhibiting its effectiveness with a strong generalization capability. Moreover, the improvement introduced by ACT is consistent with various VLMs, making it a plug-and-play solution.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03242.pdf,"Davide Talon, Federico Girella, Ziyue Liu, Marco Cristani, Yiming Wang",cs.CV
SonicRAG : High Fidelity Sound Effects Synthesis Based on Retrival Augmented Generation,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing (NLP) and multimodal learning, with successful applications in text generation and speech synthesis, enabling a deeper understanding and generation of multimodal content. In the field of sound effects (SFX) generation, LLMs have been leveraged to orchestrate multiple models for audio synthesis. However, due to the scarcity of annotated datasets, and the complexity of temproal modeling. current SFX generation techniques still fall short in achieving high-fidelity audio. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework that integrates LLMs with existing sound effect databases, allowing for the retrieval, recombination, and synthesis of audio based on user requirements. By leveraging this approach, we enhance the diversity and quality of generated sound effects while eliminating the need for additional recording costs, offering a flexible and efficient solution for sound design and application.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03244.pdf,"Yu-Ren Guo, Wen-Kai Tai",cs.SD
Non-linear dynamics of multibody systems: a system-based approach,"This paper presents causal block-diagram models to represent the equations of motion of multi-body systems in a very compact and simple closed form. Both the forward dynamics (from the forces and torques imposed at the various degrees-of-freedom to the motions of these degrees-of-freedom) or the inverse dynamics (from the motions imposed at the degrees-of-freedom to the resulting forces and torques) can be considered and described by a block diagram model. This work extends the Two-Input Two-Output Port (TITOP) theory by including all non-linear terms and uniform or gravitational acceleration fields. Connection among different blocks is possible through the definition of the motion vector. The model of a system composed of a floating base, rigid bodies, revolute and prismatic joints, working under gravity is developed to illustrate the methodology. The proposed model is validated by simulation and cross-checking with a model built using an alternative modeling tool on a scenario where the nonlinear terms are determining.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03248.pdf,"Daniel Alazard, Francesco Sanfedino, Ervan Kassarian",eess.SY
PROM: Prioritize Reduction of Multiplications Over Lower Bit-Widths for Efficient CNNs,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are crucial for computer vision tasks on resource-constrained devices. Quantization effectively compresses these models, reducing storage size and energy cost. However, in modern depthwise-separable architectures, the computational cost is distributed unevenly across its components, with pointwise operations being the most expensive. By applying a general quantization scheme to this imbalanced cost distribution, existing quantization approaches fail to fully exploit potential efficiency gains. To this end, we introduce PROM, a straightforward approach for quantizing modern depthwise-separable convolutional networks by selectively using two distinct bit-widths. Specifically, pointwise convolutions are quantized to ternary weights, while the remaining modules use 8-bit weights, which is achieved through a simple quantization-aware training procedure. Additionally, by quantizing activations to 8-bit, our method transforms pointwise convolutions with ternary weights into int8 additions, which enjoy broad support across hardware platforms and effectively eliminates the need for expensive multiplications. Applying PROM to MobileNetV2 reduces the model's energy cost by more than an order of magnitude (23.9x) and its storage size by 2.7x compared to the float16 baseline while retaining similar classification performance on ImageNet. Our method advances the Pareto frontier for energy consumption vs. top-1 accuracy for quantized convolutional models on ImageNet. PROM addresses the challenges of quantizing depthwise-separable convolutional networks to both ternary and 8-bit weights, offering a simple way to reduce energy cost and storage size.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03254.pdf,"Lukas Meiner, Jens Mehnert, Alexandru Paul Condurache",cs.CV

Model Predictive Fuzzy Control: A Hierarchical Multi-Agent Control Architecture for Outdoor Search-and-Rescue Robots,"Autonomous robots deployed in unknown search-and-rescue (SaR) environments can significantly improve the efficiency of the mission by assisting in fast localisation and rescue of the trapped victims. We propose a novel integrated hierarchical control architecture, called model predictive fuzzy control (MPFC), for autonomous mission planning of multi-robot SaR systems that should efficiently map an unknown environment: We combine model predictive control (MPC) and fuzzy logic control (FLC), where the robots are locally controlled by computationally efficient FLC controllers, and the parameters of these local controllers are tuned via a centralised MPC controller, in a regular or event-triggered manner. The proposed architecture provides three main advantages: (1) The control decisions are made by the FLC controllers, thus the real-time computation time is affordable. (2) The centralised MPC controller optimises the performance criteria with a global and predictive vision of the system dynamics, and updates the parameters of the FLC controllers accordingly. (3) FLC controllers are heuristic by nature and thus do not take into account optimality in their decisions, while the tuned parameters via the MPC controller can indirectly incorporate some level of optimality in local decisions of the robots. A simulation environment for victim detection in a disaster environment was designed in MATLAB using discrete, 2-D grid-based models. While being comparable from the point of computational efficiency, the integrated MPFC architecture improves the performance of the multi-robot SaR system compared to decentralised FLC controllers. Moreover, the performance of MPFC is comparable to the performance of centralised MPC for path planning of SaR robots, whereas MPFC requires significantly less computational resources, since the number of the optimisation variables in the control problem are reduced.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03257.pdf,"Craig Maxwell, Mirko Baglioni, Anahita Jamshidnejad",eess.SY
DiffVQA: Video Quality Assessment Using Diffusion Feature Extractor,"Video Quality Assessment (VQA) aims to evaluate video quality based on perceptual distortions and human preferences. Despite the promising performance of existing methods using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), they often struggle to align closely with human perceptions, particularly in diverse real-world scenarios. This challenge is exacerbated by the limited scale and diversity of available datasets. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel VQA framework, DiffVQA, which harnesses the robust generalization capabilities of diffusion models pre-trained on extensive datasets. Our framework adapts these models to reconstruct identical input frames through a control module. The adapted diffusion model is then used to extract semantic and distortion features from a resizing branch and a cropping branch, respectively. To enhance the model's ability to handle long-term temporal dynamics, a parallel Mamba module is introduced, which extracts temporal coherence augmented features that are merged with the diffusion features to predict the final score. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate DiffVQA's superior performance on intra-dataset evaluations and its exceptional generalization across datasets. These results confirm that leveraging a diffusion model as a feature extractor can offer enhanced VQA performance compared to CNN and ViT backbones.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03261.pdf,"Wei-Ting Chen, Yu-Jiet Vong, Yi-Tsung Lee, Sy-Yen Kuo, Qiang Gao, Sizhuo Ma, Jian Wang",cs.CV
Synthline: A Product Line Approach for Synthetic Requirements Engineering Data Generation using Large Language Models,"While modern Requirements Engineering (RE) heavily relies on natural language processing and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, their effectiveness is limited by the scarcity of high-quality datasets. This paper introduces Synthline, a Product Line (PL) approach that leverages Large Language Models to systematically generate synthetic RE data for classification-based use cases. Through an empirical evaluation conducted in the context of using ML for the identification of requirements specification defects, we investigated both the diversity of the generated data and its utility for training downstream models. Our analysis reveals that while synthetic datasets exhibit less diversity than real data, they are good enough to serve as viable training resources. Moreover, our evaluation shows that combining synthetic and real data leads to substantial performance improvements. Specifically, hybrid approaches achieve up to 85% improvement in precision and a 2x increase in recall compared to models trained exclusively on real data. These findings demonstrate the potential of PL-based synthetic data generation to address data scarcity in RE. We make both our implementation and generated datasets publicly available to support reproducibility and advancement in the field.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03265.pdf,"Abdelkarim El-Hajjami, Camille Salinesi",cs.SE
The Tensor-Core Beamformer: A High-Speed Signal-Processing Library for Multidisciplinary Use,"Beamforming is a well-known technique to combine signals from multiple sensors. It has a wide range of application domains. This paper introduces the Tensor-Core Beamformer: a generic, optimized beamformer library that harnesses the computational power of GPU tensor cores to accelerate beamforming computations. The library hides the complexity of tensor cores from the user, and supports 16-bit and 1-bit precision. An extensive performance evaluation on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs shows that the library outperforms traditional beamforming on regular GPU cores by a wide margin, at much higher energy efficiency. In the 16-bit mode, it achieves over 600 TeraOps/s on an AMD MI300X GPU, while approaching 1 TeraOp/J. In the 1-bit mode, it breaks the 3 PetaOps/s barrier and achieves over 10 TeraOps/J on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. The beamforming library can be easily integrated into existing pipelines. We demonstrate its use for medical ultrasound and radio-astronomical instruments.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03269.pdf,"Leon Oostrum, Bram Veenboer, Ronald Rook, Michael Brown, Pieter Kruizinga, John W.

SepALM: Audio Language Models Are Error Correctors for Robust Speech Separation,"While contemporary speech separation technologies adeptly process lengthy mixed audio waveforms, they are frequently challenged by the intricacies of real-world environments, including noisy and reverberant settings, which can result in artifacts or distortions in the separated speech. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SepALM, a pioneering approach that employs audio language models (ALMs) to rectify and re-synthesize speech within the text domain following preliminary separation. SepALM comprises four core components: a separator, a corrector, a synthesizer, and an aligner. By integrating an ALM-based end-to-end error correction mechanism, we mitigate the risk of error accumulation and circumvent the optimization hurdles typically encountered in conventional methods that amalgamate automatic speech recognition (ASR) with large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we have developed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and knowledge distillation techniques to facilitate the reasoning and training processes of the ALM. Our experiments substantiate that SepALM not only elevates the precision of speech separation but also markedly bolsters adaptability in novel acoustic environments.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03273.pdf,"Zhaoxi Mu, Xinyu Yang, Gang Wang",cs.SD
RAG-MCP: Mitigating Prompt Bloat in LLM Tool Selection via Retrieval-Augmented Generation,"Large language models (LLMs) struggle to effectively utilize a growing number of external tools, such as those defined by the Model Context Protocol (MCP)\cite{IntroducingMCP}, due to prompt bloat and selection complexity. We introduce RAG-MCP, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework that overcomes this challenge by offloading tool discovery. RAG-MCP uses semantic retrieval to identify the most relevant MCP(s) for a given query from an external index before engaging the LLM. Only the selected tool descriptions are passed to the model, drastically reducing prompt size and simplifying decision-making. Experiments, including an MCP stress test, demonstrate RAG-MCP significantly cuts prompt tokens (e.g., by over 50%) and more than triples tool selection accuracy (43.13% vs 13.62% baseline) on benchmark tasks. RAG-MCP enables scalable and accurate tool integration for LLMs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03275.pdf,"Tiantian Gan, Qiyao Sun",cs.AI
MDPs with a State Sensing Cost,"In many practical sequential decision-making problems, tracking the state of the environment incurs a sensing/communication/computation cost. In these settings, the agent's interaction with its environment includes the additional component of deciding $\textit{when}$ to sense the state, in a manner that balances the value associated with optimal (state-specific) actions and the cost of sensing. We formulate this as an expected discounted cost Markov Decision Process (MDP), wherein the agent incurs an additional cost for sensing its next state, but has the option to take actions while remaining 'blind' to the system state.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03280.pdf,"Vansh Kapoor, Jayakrishnan Nair",cs.LG
Physics-inspired Energy Transition Neural Network for Sequence Learning,"Recently, the superior performance of Transformers has made them a more robust and scalable solution for sequence modeling than traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, the effectiveness of Transformer in capturing long-term dependencies is primarily attributed to their comprehensive pair-modeling process rather than inherent inductive biases toward sequence semantics. In this study, we explore the capabilities of pure RNNs and reassess their long-term learning mechanisms. Inspired by the physics energy transition models that track energy changes over time, we propose a effective recurrent structure called the``Physics-inspired Energy Transition Neural Network"" (PETNN). We demonstrate that PETNN's memory mechanism effectively stores information over long-term dependencies. Experimental results indicate that PETNN outperforms transformer-based methods across various sequence tasks. Furthermore, owing to its recurrent nature, PETNN exhibits significantly lower complexity. Our study presents an optimal foundational recurrent architecture and highlights the potential for developing effective recurrent neural networks in fields currently dominated by Transformer.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03281.pdf,"Zhou Wu, Junyi An, Baile Xu, Furao Shen, Jian Zhao",cs.LG
Enabling Robots to Autonomously Search Dynamic Cluttered Post-Disaster Environments,"Robots will bring search and rescue (SaR) in disaster response to another level, in case they can autonomously take over dangerous SaR tasks from humans. A main challenge for autonomous SaR robots is to safely navigate in cluttered environments with uncertainties, while avoiding static and moving obstacles. We propose an integrated control framework for SaR robots in dynamic, uncertain environments, including a computationally efficient heuristic motion planning system that provides a nominal (assuming there are no uncertainties) collision-free trajectory for SaR robots and a robust motion tracking system that steers the robot to track this reference trajectory, taking into account the impact of uncertainties. The control architecture guarantees a balanced trade-off among various SaR objectives, while handling the hard constraints, including safety. The results of various computer-based simulations, presented in this paper, showed significant out-performance (of up to 42.3%) of the proposed integrated control architecture compared to two commonly used state-of-the-art methods (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree and Artificial Potential Function) in reaching targets (e.g., trapped victims in SaR) safely, collision-free, and in the shortest possible time.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03283.pdf,"Karlo Rado, Mirko Baglioni, Anahita Jamshidnejad",cs.RO
OccCylindrical: Multi-Modal Fusion with Cylindrical Representation for 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction,"The safe operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is highly dependent on their understanding of the surroundings. For this, the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction divides the space around the sensors into voxels, and labels each voxel with both occupancy and semantic information. Recent perception models have used multisensor fusion to perform this task. However, existing multisensor fusion-based approaches focus mainly on using sensor information in the Cartesian coordinate system. This ignores the distribution of the sensor readings, leading to a loss of fine-grained details and performance degradation. In this paper, we propose OccCylindrical that merges and refines the different modality features under cylindrical coordinates. Our method preserves more fine-grained geometry detail that leads to better performance. Extensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset, including challenging rainy and nighttime scenarios, confirm our approach's effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance. The code will be available at: https://github.com/DanielMing123/OccCylindrical",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03284.pdf,"Zhenxing Ming, Julie Stephany Berrio, Mao Shan, Yaoqi Huang, Hongyu Lyu, Nguyen Hoang Khoi Tran, Tzu-Yun Tseng, Stewart Worrall",cs.CV
Soft Reasoning Paths for Knowledge Graph Completion,"Reasoning paths are reliable information in knowledge graph completion (KGC) in which algorithms can find strong clues of the actual relation between entities. However, in real-world applications, it is difficult to guarantee that computationally affordable paths exist toward all candidate entities. According to our observation, the prediction accuracy drops significantly when paths are absent. To make the proposed algorithm more stable against the missing path circumstances, we introduce soft reasoning paths. Concretely, a specific learnable latent path embedding is concatenated to each relation to help better model the characteristics of the corresponding paths. The combination of the relation and the corresponding learnable embedding is termed a soft path in our paper. By aligning the soft paths with the reasoning paths, a learnable embedding is guided to learn a generalized path representation of the corresponding relation. In addition, we introduce a hierarchical ranking strategy to make full use of information about the entity, relation, path, and soft path to help improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the model. Extensive experimental results illustrate that our algorithm outperforms the compared state-of-the-art algorithms by a notable margin. The code will be made publicly available after the paper is officially accepted.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03285.pdf,"Yanning Hou, Sihang Zhou, Ke Liang, Lingyuan Meng, Xiaoshu Chen, Ke Xu, Siwei Wang, Xinwang Liu, Jian Huang",cs.IR
Base-Detail Feature Learning Framework for Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification,"Visible-infrared person re-identification (VIReID) provides a solution for ReID tasks in 24-hour scenarios; however, significant challenges persist in achieving satisfactory performance due to the substantial discrepancies between visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) modalities. Existing methods inadequately leverage information from different modalities, primarily focusing on digging distinguishing features from modality-shared information while neglecting modality-specific details. To fully utilize differentiated minutiae, we propose a Base-Detail Feature Learning Framework (BDLF) that enhances the learning of both base and detail knowledge, thereby capitalizing on both modality-shared and modality-specific information. Specifically, the proposed BDLF mines detail and base features through a lossless detail feature extraction module and a complementary base embedding generation mechanism, respectively, supported by a novel correlation restriction method that ensures the features gained by BDLF enrich both detail and base knowledge across VIS and IR features. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the SYSU-MM01, RegDB, and LLCM datasets validate the effectiveness of BDLF.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03286.pdf,"Zhihao Gong, Lian Wu, Yong Xu",cs.CV
Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Zonal Ancillary Market Coupling,"We characterize zonal ancillary market coupling relying on noncooperative game theory. To that purpose, we formulate the ancillary market as a multi-leader single follower bilevel problem, that we subsequently cast as a generalized Nash game with side constraints and nonconvex feasibility sets. We determine conditions for equilibrium existence and show that the game has a generalized potential game structure. To compute market equilibrium, we rely on two exact approaches: an integrated optimization approach and Gauss-Seidel best-response, that we compare against multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. On real data from Germany and Austria, simulations indicate that multi-agent deep reinforcement learning achieves the smallest convergence rate but requires pretraining, while best-response is the slowest. On the economics side, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning results in smaller market costs compared to the exact methods, but at the cost of higher variability in the profit allocation among stakeholders. Further, stronger coupling between zones tends to reduce costs for larger zones.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03288.pdf,"Francesco Morri, H\'el\`ene Le Cadre, Pierre Gruet, Luce Brotcorne",cs.MA
{\Psi}-Arena: Interactive Assessment and Optimization of LLM-based Psychological Counselors with Tripartite Feedback,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in providing scalable mental health support, while evaluating their counseling capability remains crucial to ensure both efficacy and safety. Existing evaluations are limited by the static assessment that focuses on knowledge tests, the single perspective that centers on user experience, and the open-loop framework that lacks actionable feedback. To address these issues, we propose {\Psi}-Arena, an interactive framework for comprehensive assessment and optimization of LLM-based counselors, featuring three key characteristics: (1) Realistic arena interactions that simulate real-world counseling through multi-stage dialogues with psychologically profiled NPC clients, (2) Tripartite evaluation that integrates assessments from the client, counselor, and supervisor perspectives, and (3) Closed-loop optimization that iteratively improves LLM counselors using diagnostic feedback. Experiments across eight state-of-the-art LLMs show significant performance variations in different real-world scenarios and evaluation perspectives. Moreover, reflection-based optimization results in up to a 141% improvement in counseling performance. We hope PsychoArena provides a foundational resource for advancing reliable and human-aligned LLM applications in mental healthcare.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03293.pdf,"Shijing Zhu, Zhuang Chen, Guanqun Bi, Binghang Li, Yaxi Deng, Dazhen Wan, Libiao Peng, Xiyao Xiao, Rongsheng Zhang, Tangjie Lv, Zhipeng Hu, FangFang Li, Minlie Huang",cs.CL
Capability-Driven Skill Generation with LLMs: A RAG-Based Approach for Reusing Existing Libraries and Interfaces,"Modern automation systems increasingly rely on modular architectures, with capabilities and skills as one solution approach. Capabilities define the functions of resources in a machine-readable form and skills provide the concrete implementations that realize those capabilities. However, the development of a skill implementation conforming to a corresponding capability remains a time-consuming and challenging task. In this paper, we present a method that treats capabilities as contracts for skill implementations and leverages large language models to generate executable code based on natural language user input. A key feature of our approach is the integration of existing software libraries and interface technologies, enabling the generation of skill implementations across different target languages. We introduce a framework that allows users to incorporate their own libraries and resource interfaces into the code generation process through a retrieval-augmented generation architecture.

The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Discrete-Time Gaussian Process Mixtures for Robot Policy Learning,"We present Mixture of Discrete-time Gaussian Processes (MiDiGap), a novel approach for flexible policy representation and imitation learning in robot manipulation. MiDiGap enables learning from as few as five demonstrations using only camera observations and generalizes across a wide range of challenging tasks. It excels at long-horizon behaviors such as making coffee, highly constrained motions such as opening doors, dynamic actions such as scooping with a spatula, and multimodal tasks such as hanging a mug. MiDiGap learns these tasks on a CPU in less than a minute and scales linearly to large datasets. We also develop a rich suite of tools for inference-time steering using evidence such as collision signals and robot kinematic constraints. This steering enables novel generalization capabilities, including obstacle avoidance and cross-embodiment policy transfer. MiDiGap achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse few-shot manipulation benchmarks. On constrained RLBench tasks, it improves policy success by 76 percentage points and reduces trajectory cost by 67%. On multimodal tasks, it improves policy success by 48 percentage points and increases sample efficiency by a factor of 20. In cross-embodiment transfer, it more than doubles policy success.

Towards Efficient Benchmarking of Foundation Models in Remote Sensing: A Capabilities Encoding Approach,"Foundation models constitute a significant advancement in computer vision: after a single, albeit costly, training phase, they can address a wide array of tasks. In the field of Earth observation, over 75 remote sensing vision foundation models have been developed in the past four years. However, none has consistently outperformed the others across all available downstream tasks. To facilitate their comparison, we propose a cost-effective method for predicting a model's performance on multiple downstream tasks without the need for fine-tuning on each one. This method is based on what we call ""capabilities encoding."" The utility of this novel approach is twofold: we demonstrate its potential to simplify the selection of a foundation model for a given new task, and we employ it to offer a fresh perspective on the existing literature, suggesting avenues for future research.

3D Can Be Explored In 2D: Pseudo-Label Generation for LiDAR Point Clouds Using Sensor-Intensity-Based 2D Semantic Segmentation,"Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR point clouds, essential for autonomous driving and infrastructure management, is best achieved by supervised learning, which demands extensive annotated datasets and faces the problem of domain shifts. We introduce a new 3D semantic segmentation pipeline that leverages aligned scenes and state-of-the-art 2D segmentation methods, avoiding the need for direct 3D annotation or reliance on additional modalities such as camera images at inference time. Our approach generates 2D views from LiDAR scans colored by sensor intensity and applies 2D semantic segmentation to these views using a camera-domain pretrained model. The segmented 2D outputs are then back-projected onto the 3D points, with a simple voting-based estimator that merges the labels associated to each 3D point. Our main contribution is a global pipeline for 3D semantic segmentation requiring no prior 3D annotation and not other modality for inference, which can be used for pseudo-label generation. We conduct a thorough ablation study and demonstrate the potential of the generated pseudo-labels for the Unsupervised Domain Adaptation task.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03300.pdf,"Andrew Caunes, Thierry Chateau, Vincent Fr\'emont",cs.CV
Comparative Analysis of Lightweight Deep Learning Models for Memory-Constrained Devices,"This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of lightweight deep learning models for image classification, emphasizing their suitability for deployment in resource-constrained environments such as low-memory devices. Five state-of-the-art architectures - MobileNetV3 Small, ResNet18, SqueezeNet, EfficientNetV2-S, and ShuffleNetV2 - are benchmarked across three diverse datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet. The models are assessed using four key performance metrics: classification accuracy, inference time, floating-point operations (FLOPs), and model size. Additionally, we investigate the impact of hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, and training paradigms by comparing pretrained models with scratch-trained counterparts, focusing on MobileNetV3 Small. Our findings reveal that transfer learning significantly enhances model accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly for complex datasets like Tiny ImageNet. EfficientNetV2 consistently achieves the highest accuracy, while MobileNetV3 offers the best balance between accuracy and efficiency, and SqueezeNet excels in inference speed and compactness. This study highlights critical trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, offering actionable insights for deploying lightweight models in real-world applications where computational resources are limited.

3D Gaussian Splatting Data Compression with Mixture of Priors,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) data compression is crucial for enabling efficient storage and transmission in 3D scene modeling. However, its development remains limited due to inadequate entropy models and suboptimal quantization strategies for both lossless and lossy compression scenarios, where existing methods have yet to 1) fully leverage hyperprior information to construct robust conditional entropy models, and 2) apply fine-grained, element-wise quantization strategies for improved compression granularity. In this work, we propose a novel Mixture of Priors (MoP) strategy to simultaneously address these two challenges. Specifically, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, our MoP approach processes hyperprior information through multiple lightweight MLPs to generate diverse prior features, which are subsequently integrated into the MoP feature via a gating mechanism. To enhance lossless compression, the resulting MoP feature is utilized as a hyperprior to improve conditional entropy modeling. Meanwhile, for lossy compression, we employ the MoP feature as guidance information in an element-wise quantization procedure, leveraging a prior-guided Coarse-to-Fine Quantization (C2FQ) strategy with a predefined quantization step value. Specifically, we expand the quantization step value into a matrix and adaptively refine it from coarse to fine granularity, guided by the MoP feature, thereby obtaining a quantization step matrix that facilitates element-wise quantization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed 3DGS data compression framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including Mip-NeRF360, BungeeNeRF, DeepBlending, and Tank&Temples.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03310.pdf,"Lei Liu, Zhenghao Chen, Dong Xu",cs.CV
Mamba-Diffusion Model with Learnable Wavelet for Controllable Symbolic Music Generation,"The recent surge in the popularity of diffusion models for image synthesis has attracted new attention to their potential for generation tasks in other domains. However, their applications to symbolic music generation remain largely under-explored because symbolic music is typically represented as sequences of discrete events and standard diffusion models are not well-suited for discrete data. We represent symbolic music as image-like pianorolls, facilitating the use of diffusion models for the generation of symbolic music. Moreover, this study introduces a novel diffusion model that incorporates our proposed Transformer-Mamba block and learnable wavelet transform. Classifier-free guidance is utilised to generate symbolic music with target chords. Our evaluation shows that our method achieves compelling results in terms of music quality and controllability, outperforming the strong baseline in pianoroll generation.

"Artificial Behavior Intelligence: Technology, Challenges, and Future Directions","Understanding and predicting human behavior has emerged as a core capability in various AI application domains such as autonomous driving, smart healthcare, surveillance systems, and social robotics. This paper defines the technical framework of Artificial Behavior Intelligence (ABI), which comprehensively analyzes and interprets human posture, facial expressions, emotions, behavioral sequences, and contextual cues. It details the essential components of ABI, including pose estimation, face and emotion recognition, sequential behavior analysis, and context-aware modeling. Furthermore, we highlight the transformative potential of recent advances in large-scale pretrained models, such as large language models (LLMs), vision foundation models, and multimodal integration models, in significantly improving the accuracy and interpretability of behavior recognition. Our research team has a strong interest in the ABI domain and is actively conducting research, particularly focusing on the development of intelligent lightweight models capable of efficiently inferring complex human behaviors. This paper identifies several technical challenges that must be addressed to deploy ABI in real-world applications including learning behavioral intelligence from limited data, quantifying uncertainty in complex behavior prediction, and optimizing model structures for low-power, real-time inference. To tackle these challenges, our team is exploring various optimization strategies including lightweight transformers, graph-based recognition architectures, energy-aware loss functions, and multimodal knowledge distillation, while validating their applicability in real-time environments.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03315.pdf,"Kanghyun Jo, Jehwan Choi, Kwanho Kim, Seongmin Kim, Duy-Linh Nguyen, Xuan-Thuy Vo, Adri Priadana, Tien-Dat Tran",cs.AI
Unified Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reward Model through Reinforcement Fine-Tuning,"Recent advances in multimodal Reward Models (RMs) have shown significant promise in delivering reward signals to align vision models with human preferences. However, current RMs are generally restricted to providing direct responses or engaging in shallow reasoning processes with limited depth, often leading to inaccurate reward signals. We posit that incorporating explicit long chains of thought (CoT) into the reward reasoning process can significantly strengthen their reliability and robustness. Furthermore, we believe that once RMs internalize CoT reasoning, their direct response accuracy can also be improved through implicit reasoning capabilities. To this end, this paper proposes UnifiedReward-Think, the first unified multimodal CoT-based reward model, capable of multi-dimensional, step-by-step long-chain reasoning for both visual understanding and generation reward tasks. Specifically, we adopt an exploration-driven reinforcement fine-tuning approach to elicit and incentivize the model's latent complex reasoning ability: (1) We first use a small amount of image generation preference data to distill the reasoning process of GPT-4o, which is then used for the model's cold start to learn the format and structure of CoT reasoning. (2) Subsequently, by leveraging the model's prior knowledge and generalization capabilities, we prepare large-scale unified multimodal preference data to elicit the model's reasoning process across various vision tasks. During this phase, correct reasoning outputs are retained for rejection sampling to refine the model (3) while incorrect predicted samples are finally used for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement fine-tuning, enabling the model to explore diverse reasoning paths and optimize for correct and robust solutions. Extensive experiments across various vision reward tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03318.pdf,"Yibin Wang, Zhimin Li, Yuhang Zang, Chunyu Wang, Qinglin Lu, Cheng Jin, Jiaqi Wang",cs.CV
SD-VSum: A Method and Dataset for Script-Driven Video Summarization,"In this work, we introduce the task of script-driven video summarization, which aims to produce a summary of the full-length video by selecting the parts that are most relevant to a user-provided script outlining the visual content of the desired summary. Following, we extend a recently-introduced large-scale dataset for generic video summarization (VideoXum) by producing natural language descriptions of the different human-annotated summaries that are available per video. In this way we make it compatible with the introduced task, since the available triplets of ``video, summary and summary description'' can be used for training a method that is able to produce different summaries for a given video, driven by the provided script about the content of each summary. Finally, we develop a new network architecture for script-driven video summarization (SD-VSum), that relies on the use of a cross-modal attention mechanism for aligning and fusing information from the visual and text modalities. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the advanced performance of SD-VSum against state-of-the-art approaches for query-driven and generic (unimodal and multimodal) summarization from the literature, and document its capacity to produce video summaries that are adapted to each user's needs about their content.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03319.pdf,"Manolis Mylonas, Evlampios Apostolidis, Vasileios Mezaris",cs.CV
Recall with Reasoning: Chain-of-Thought Distillation for Mamba's Long-Context Memory and Extrapolation,"Mamba's theoretical infinite-context potential is limited in practice when sequences far exceed training lengths. This work explores unlocking Mamba's long-context memory ability by a simple-yet-effective method, Recall with Reasoning (RwR), by distilling chain-of-thought (CoT) summarization from a teacher model. Specifically, RwR prepends these summarization as CoT prompts during fine-tuning, teaching Mamba to actively recall and reason over long contexts. Experiments on LONGMEMEVAL and HELMET show RwR boosts Mamba's long-context performance against comparable Transformer/hybrid baselines under similar pretraining conditions, while preserving short-context capabilities, all without architectural changes.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03320.pdf,"Junyu Ma, Tianqing Fang, Zhisong Zhang, Hongming Zhang, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu",cs.CL
Unraveling the Rainbow: can value-based methods schedule?,"Recently, deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising approach for solving complex combinatorial optimization problems. Broadly, deep reinforcement learning methods fall into two categories: policy-based and value-based. While value-based approaches have achieved notable success in domains such as the Arcade Learning Environment, the combinatorial optimization community has predominantly favored policy-based methods, often overlooking the potential of value-based algorithms. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of value-based algorithms, including the deep q-network and several of its advanced extensions, within the context of two complex combinatorial problems: the job-shop and the flexible job-shop scheduling problems, two fundamental challenges with multiple industrial applications. Our results challenge the assumption that policy-based methods are inherently superior for combinatorial optimization. We show that several value-based approaches can match or even outperform the widely adopted proximal policy optimization algorithm, suggesting that value-based strategies deserve greater attention from the combinatorial optimization community.

Very High-Resolution Forest Mapping with TanDEM-X InSAR Data and Self-Supervised Learning,"Deep learning models have shown encouraging capabilities for mapping accurately forests at medium resolution with TanDEM-X interferometric SAR data. Such models, as most of current state-of-the-art deep learning techniques in remote sensing, are trained in a fully-supervised way, which requires a large amount of labeled data for training and validation. In this work, our aim is to exploit the high-resolution capabilities of the TanDEM-X mission to map forests at 6 m. The goal is to overcome the intrinsic limitations posed by midresolution products, which affect, e.g., the detection of narrow roads within vegetated areas and the precise delineation of forested regions contours. To cope with the lack of extended reliable reference datasets at such a high resolution, we investigate self-supervised learning techniques for extracting highly informative representations from the input features, followed by a supervised training step with a significantly smaller number of reliable labels. A 1 m resolution forest/non-forest reference map over Pennsylvania, USA, allows for comparing different training approaches for the development of an effective forest mapping framework with limited labeled samples. We select the best-performing approach over this test region and apply it in a real-case forest mapping scenario over the Amazon rainforest, where only very few labeled data at high resolution are available. In this challenging scenario, the proposed self-supervised framework significantly enhances the classification accuracy with respect to fully-supervised methods, trained using the same amount of labeled data, representing an extremely promising starting point for large-scale, very high-resolution forest mapping with TanDEM-X data.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03327.pdf,"Jos\'e-Luis Bueso-Bello, Benjamin Chauvel, Daniel Carcereri, Philipp Posovszky, Pietro Milillo, Jennifer Ruiz, Juan-Carlos Fern\'andez-Diaz, Carolina Gonz\'alez, Michele Martone, Ronny H\""ansch, Paola Rizzoli",cs.CV
FLUX-Text: A Simple and Advanced Diffusion Transformer Baseline for Scene Text Editing,"The task of scene text editing is to modify or add texts on images while maintaining the fidelity of newly generated text and visual coherence with the background. Recent works based on latent diffusion models (LDM) show improved text editing results, yet still face challenges and often generate inaccurate or unrecognizable characters, especially for non-Latin ones (\eg, Chinese), which have complex glyph structures. To address these issues, we present FLUX-Text, a simple and advanced multilingual scene text editing framework based on FLUX-Fill. Specifically, we carefully investigate glyph conditioning, considering both visual and textual modalities. To retain the original generative capabilities of FLUX-Fill while enhancing its understanding and generation of glyphs, we propose lightweight glyph and text embedding modules. Owning to the lightweight design, FLUX-Text is trained only with $100K$ training examples compared to current popular methods trained with 2.9M ones. With no bells and whistles, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on text editing tasks. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on the public datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses previous works in text fidelity.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03329.pdf,"Rui Lan, Yancheng Bai, Xu Duan, Mingxing Li, Lei Sun, Xiangxiang Chu",cs.CV
Miniature multihole airflow sensor for lightweight aircraft over wide speed and angular range,"An aircraft's airspeed, angle of attack, and angle of side slip are crucial to its safety, especially when flying close to the stall regime. Various solutions exist, including pitot tubes, angular vanes, and multihole pressure probes. However, current sensors are either too heavy (>30 g) or require large airspeeds (>20 m/s), making them unsuitable for small uncrewed aerial vehicles. We propose a novel multihole pressure probe, integrating sensing electronics in a single-component structure, resulting in a mechanically robust and lightweight sensor (9 g), which we released to the public domain. Since there is no consensus on two critical design parameters, tip shape (conical vs spherical) and hole spacing (distance between holes), we provide a study on measurement accuracy and noise generation using wind tunnel experiments. The sensor is calibrated using a multivariate polynomial regression model over an airspeed range of 3-27 m/s and an angle of attack/sideslip range of +-35{\deg}, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.44 m/s and 0.16{\deg}. Finally, we validated the sensor in outdoor flights near the stall regime. Our probe enabled accurate estimations of airspeed, angle of attack and sideslip during different acrobatic manoeuvres. Due to its size and weight, this sensor will enable safe flight for lightweight, uncrewed aerial vehicles flying at low speeds close to the stall regime.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03331.pdf,"Lukas Stuber, Simon Jeger, Raphael Zufferey, Dario Floreano",cs.RO
"AI-Driven Scholarly Peer Review via Persistent Workflow Prompting, Meta-Prompting, and Meta-Reasoning","Critical peer review of scientific manuscripts presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), partly due to data limitations and the complexity of expert reasoning. This report introduces Persistent Workflow Prompting (PWP), a potentially broadly applicable prompt engineering methodology designed to bridge this gap using standard LLM chat interfaces (zero-code, no APIs). We present a proof-of-concept PWP prompt for the critical analysis of experimental chemistry manuscripts, featuring a hierarchical, modular architecture (structured via Markdown) that defines detailed analysis workflows. We develop this PWP prompt through iterative application of meta-prompting techniques and meta-reasoning aimed at systematically codifying expert review workflows, including tacit knowledge. Submitted once at the start of a session, this PWP prompt equips the LLM with persistent workflows triggered by subsequent queries, guiding modern reasoning LLMs through systematic, multimodal evaluations. Demonstrations show the PWP-guided LLM identifying major methodological flaws in a test case while mitigating LLM input bias and performing complex tasks, including distinguishing claims from evidence, integrating text/photo/figure analysis to infer parameters, executing quantitative feasibility checks, comparing estimates against claims, and assessing a priori plausibility. To ensure transparency and facilitate replication, we provide full prompts, detailed demonstration analyses, and logs of interactive chats as supplementary resources. Beyond the specific application, this work offers insights into the meta-development process itself, highlighting the potential of PWP, informed by detailed workflow formalization, to enable sophisticated analysis using readily available LLMs for complex scientific tasks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03332.pdf,Evgeny Markhasin,cs.AI
From Word to Sentence: A Large-Scale Multi-Instance Dataset for Open-Set Aerial Detection,"In recent years, language-guided open-world aerial object detection has gained significant attention due to its better alignment with real-world application needs. However, due to limited datasets, most existing language-guided methods primarily focus on vocabulary, which fails to meet the demands of more fine-grained open-world detection. To address this limitation, we propose constructing a large-scale language-guided open-set aerial detection dataset, encompassing three levels of language guidance: from words to phrases, and ultimately to sentences. Centered around an open-source large vision-language model and integrating image-operation-based preprocessing with BERT-based postprocessing, we present the OS-W2S Label Engine, an automatic annotation pipeline capable of handling diverse scene annotations for aerial images. Using this label engine, we expand existing aerial detection datasets with rich textual annotations and construct a novel benchmark dataset, called Multi-instance Open-set Aerial Dataset (MI-OAD), addressing the limitations of current remote sensing grounding data and enabling effective open-set aerial detection. Specifically, MI-OAD contains 163,023 images and 2 million image-caption pairs, approximately 40 times larger than comparable datasets. We also employ state-of-the-art open-set methods from the natural image domain, trained on our proposed dataset, to validate the model's open-set detection capabilities. For instance, when trained on our dataset, Grounding DINO achieves improvements of 29.5 AP_{50} and 33.7 Recall@10 for sentence inputs under zero-shot transfer conditions. Both the dataset and the label engine will be released publicly.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03334.pdf,"Guoting Wei, Yu Liu, Xia Yuan, Xizhe Xue, Linlin Guo, Yifan Yang, Chunxia Zhao, Zongwen Bai, Haokui Zhang, Rong Xiao",cs.CV
Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data,"Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown promise in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models by learning directly from outcome-based rewards. Recent RLVR works that operate under the zero setting avoid supervision in labeling the reasoning process, but still depend on manually curated collections of questions and answers for training. The scarcity of high-quality, human-produced examples raises concerns about the long-term scalability of relying on human supervision, a challenge already evident in the domain of language model pretraining. Furthermore, in a hypothetical future where AI surpasses human intelligence, tasks provided by humans may offer limited learning potential for a superintelligent system. To address these concerns, we propose a new RLVR paradigm called Absolute Zero, in which a single model learns to propose tasks that maximize its own learning progress and improves reasoning by solving them, without relying on any external data. Under this paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), a system that self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability by using a code executor to both validate proposed code reasoning tasks and verify answers, serving as an unified source of verifiable reward to guide open-ended yet grounded learning. Despite being trained entirely without external data, AZR achieves overall SOTA performance on coding and mathematical reasoning tasks, outperforming existing zero-setting models that rely on tens of thousands of in-domain human-curated examples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AZR can be effectively applied across different model scales and is compatible with various model classes.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03335.pdf,"Andrew Zhao, Yiran Wu, Yang Yue, Tong Wu, Quentin Xu, Yang Yue, Matthieu Lin, Shenzhi Wang, Qingyun Wu, Zilong Zheng, Gao Huang",cs.LG
Avoid Recommending Out-of-Domain Items: Constrained Generative Recommendation with LLMs,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for generative recommender systems due to their transformative capabilities in user interaction. However, ensuring they do not recommend out-of-domain (OOD) items remains a challenge. We study two distinct methods to address this issue: RecLM-ret, a retrieval-based method, and RecLM-cgen, a constrained generation method. Both methods integrate seamlessly with existing LLMs to ensure in-domain recommendations. Comprehensive experiments on three recommendation datasets demonstrate that RecLM-cgen consistently outperforms RecLM-ret and existing LLM-based recommender models in accuracy while eliminating OOD recommendations, making it the preferred method for adoption. Additionally, RecLM-cgen maintains strong generalist capabilities and is a lightweight plug-and-play module for easy integration into LLMs, offering valuable practical benefits for the community.

The Inverse Drum Machine: Source Separation Through Joint Transcription and Analysis-by-Synthesis,"We introduce the Inverse Drum Machine (IDM), a novel approach to drum source separation that combines analysis-by-synthesis with deep learning. Unlike recent supervised methods that rely on isolated stems, IDM requires only transcription annotations. It jointly optimizes automatic drum transcription and one-shot drum sample synthesis in an end-to-end framework. By convolving synthesized one-shot samples with estimated onsets-mimicking a drum machine-IDM reconstructs individual drum stems and trains a neural network to match the original mixture. Evaluations on the StemGMD dataset show that IDM achieves separation performance on par with state-of-the-art supervised methods, while substantially outperforming matrix decomposition baselines.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03337.pdf,"Bernardo Torres (S2A, IDS), Geoffroy Peeters (S2A, IDS), Gael Richard (S2A, IDS)",cs.SD
Safer Prompts: Reducing IP Risk in Visual Generative AI,"Visual Generative AI models have demonstrated remarkable capability in generating high-quality images from simple inputs like text prompts. However, because these models are trained on images from diverse sources, they risk memorizing and reproducing specific content, raising concerns about intellectual property (IP) infringement. Recent advances in prompt engineering offer a cost-effective way to enhance generative AI performance. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of prompt engineering techniques in mitigating IP infringement risks in image generation. Our findings show that Chain of Thought Prompting and Task Instruction Prompting significantly reduce the similarity between generated images and the training data of diffusion models, thereby lowering the risk of IP infringement.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03338.pdf,"Lena Reissinger, Yuanyuan Li, Anna-Carolina Haensch, Neeraj Sarna",math.NA
RIFT: Closed-Loop RL Fine-Tuning for Realistic and Controllable Traffic Simulation,"Achieving both realism and controllability in interactive closed-loop traffic simulation remains a key challenge in autonomous driving. Data-driven simulation methods reproduce realistic trajectories but suffer from covariate shift in closed-loop deployment, compounded by simplified dynamics models that further reduce reliability. Conversely, physics-based simulation methods enhance reliable and controllable closed-loop interactions but often lack expert demonstrations, compromising realism. To address these challenges, we introduce a dual-stage AV-centered simulation framework that conducts open-loop imitation learning pre-training in a data-driven simulator to capture trajectory-level realism and multimodality, followed by closed-loop reinforcement learning fine-tuning in a physics-based simulator to enhance controllability and mitigate covariate shift. In the fine-tuning stage, we propose RIFT, a simple yet effective closed-loop RL fine-tuning strategy that preserves the trajectory-level multimodality through a GRPO-style group-relative advantage formulation, while enhancing controllability and training stability by replacing KL regularization with the dual-clip mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFT significantly improves the realism and controllability of generated traffic scenarios, providing a robust platform for evaluating autonomous vehicle performance in diverse and interactive scenarios.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03344.pdf,"Keyu Chen, Wenchao Sun, Hao Cheng, Sifa Zheng",cs.RO
Elevating Cyber Threat Intelligence against Disinformation Campaigns with LLM-based Concept Extraction and the FakeCTI Dataset,"The swift spread of fake news and disinformation campaigns poses a significant threat to public trust, political stability, and cybersecurity. Traditional Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) approaches, which rely on low-level indicators such as domain names and social media handles, are easily evaded by adversaries who frequently modify their online infrastructure. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel CTI framework that focuses on high-level, semantic indicators derived from recurrent narratives and relationships of disinformation campaigns. Our approach extracts structured CTI indicators from unstructured disinformation content, capturing key entities and their contextual dependencies within fake news using Large Language Models (LLMs). We further introduce FakeCTI, the first dataset that systematically links fake news to disinformation campaigns and threat actors. To evaluate the effectiveness of our CTI framework, we analyze multiple fake news attribution techniques, spanning from traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) to fine-tuned LLMs. This work shifts the focus from low-level artifacts to persistent conceptual structures, establishing a scalable and adaptive approach to tracking and countering disinformation campaigns.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03345.pdf,"Domenico Cotroneo, Roberto Natella, Vittorio Orbinato",cs.CR
Variable projection framework for the reduced-rank matrix approximation problem by weighted least-squares,"In this monograph, we review and develop variable projection Gauss-Newton, Levenberg-Marquardt and Newton methods for the Weighted Low-Rank Approximation (WLRA) problem, which has now an increasing number of applications in many scientific fields. Particular attention is drawn at the robustness, efficiency and scalability of these variable projection second-order algorithms such that they can be used also on larger datasets now commonly found in many practical problems for which only first-order algorithms based on sequential repetitions of local optimization (e.g., majorization, Expectation-Maximization or alternating least-squares methods) or variations of gradient descent (e.g., conjugate, proximal or stochastic gradient descent methods), or hybrid algorithms from these two classes of methods, were only feasible due to their lower cost and memory requirement per iteration. In parallel with this review of variable projection algorithms, we develop new formulae for the Jacobian and Hessian matrices involved in these variable projection methods and demonstrate their very specific properties such as the uniform rank deficiency of the Jacobian matrix or the rank deficiency of the Hessian matrix at the (local) minimizers of the cost function associated with the WLRA problem. These systematic deficiencies must be taken into account in any practical implementations of the algorithms. These different properties and the very particular geometry of the WLRA problem have not been well appreciated in the past and have been the main obstacles in the development of robust variable projection second-order algorithms for solving the WLRA problem. In addition, we demonstrate that the variable projection framework gives original insights on the solvability, the landscape and the non-smoothness of the WLRA problem. It also helps to describe the tight links between previously unrelated methods, which have been proposed to solve it. Specifically, we illustrate the closed links between the variable projection framework and Riemannian optimization on the Grassmann manifold for the WLRA problem. We expect that software's developers and practitioners in different fields such as computer vision, signal processing, recommender systems, machine learning, multivariate statistics and geophysical sciences will benefit from the results in this monograph in order to devise more robust and accurate algorithms to solve the WLRA problem.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03347.pdf,"Pascal Terray (LOCEAN, IRD)",math.NA
Stochastic scheduling with Bernoulli-type jobs through policy stratification,"This paper addresses the problem of computing a scheduling policy that minimizes the total expected completion time of a set of $N$ jobs with stochastic processing times on $m$ parallel identical machines. When all processing times follow Bernoulli-type distributions, Gupta et al. (SODA '23) exhibited approximation algorithms with an approximation guarantee $\tilde{\text{O}}(\sqrt{m})$, where $m$ is the number of machines and $\tilde{\text{O}}(\cdot)$ suppresses polylogarithmic factors in $N$, improving upon an earlier ${\text{O}}(m)$ approximation by Eberle et al. (OR Letters '19) for a special case. The present paper shows that, quite unexpectedly, the problem with Bernoulli-type jobs admits a PTAS whenever the number of different job-size parameters is bounded by a constant. The result is based on a series of transformations of an optimal scheduling policy to a ""stratified"" policy that makes scheduling decisions at specific points in time only, while losing only a negligible factor in expected cost. An optimal stratified policy is computed using dynamic programming. Two technical issues are solved, namely (i) to ensure that, with at most a slight delay, the stratified policy has an information advantage over the optimal policy, allowing it to simulate its decisions, and (ii) to ensure that the delays do not accumulate, thus solving the trade-off between the complexity of the scheduling policy and its expected cost. Our results also imply a quasi-polynomial $\text{O}(\log N)$-approximation for the case with an arbitrary number of job sizes.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03349.pdf,"Antonios Antoniadis, Ruben Hoeksma, Kevin Schewior, Marc Uetz",cs.DS
A Vision-Language Model for Focal Liver Lesion Classification,"Accurate classification of focal liver lesions is crucial for diagnosis and treatment in hepatology. However, traditional supervised deep learning models depend on large-scale annotated datasets, which are often limited in medical imaging. Recently, Vision-Language models (VLMs) such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training model (CLIP) has been applied to image classifications. Compared to the conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), which classifiers image based on visual information only, VLM leverages multimodal learning with text and images, allowing it to learn effectively even with a limited amount of labeled data. Inspired by CLIP, we pro-pose a Liver-VLM, a model specifically designed for focal liver lesions (FLLs) classification. First, Liver-VLM incorporates class information into the text encoder without introducing additional inference overhead. Second, by calculating the pairwise cosine similarities between image and text embeddings and optimizing the model with a cross-entropy loss, Liver-VLM ef-fectively aligns image features with class-level text features. Experimental results on MPCT-FLLs dataset demonstrate that the Liver-VLM model out-performs both the standard CLIP and MedCLIP models in terms of accuracy and Area Under the Curve (AUC). Further analysis shows that using a lightweight ResNet18 backbone enhances classification performance, particularly under data-constrained conditions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03350.pdf,"Song Jian, Hu Yuchang, Wang Hui, Chen Yen-Wei",cs.CV
GUAVA: Generalizable Upper Body 3D Gaussian Avatar,"Reconstructing a high-quality, animatable 3D human avatar with expressive facial and hand motions from a single image has gained significant attention due to its broad application potential. 3D human avatar reconstruction typically requires multi-view or monocular videos and training on individual IDs, which is both complex and time-consuming. Furthermore, limited by SMPLX's expressiveness, these methods often focus on body motion but struggle with facial expressions. To address these challenges, we first introduce an expressive human model (EHM) to enhance facial expression capabilities and develop an accurate tracking method. Based on this template model, we propose GUAVA, the first framework for fast animatable upper-body 3D Gaussian avatar reconstruction. We leverage inverse texture mapping and projection sampling techniques to infer Ubody (upper-body) Gaussians from a single image. The rendered images are refined through a neural refiner. Experimental results demonstrate that GUAVA significantly outperforms previous methods in rendering quality and offers significant speed improvements, with reconstruction times in the sub-second range (0.1s), and supports real-time animation and rendering.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03351.pdf,"Dongbin Zhang, Yunfei Liu, Lijian Lin, Ye Zhu, Yang Li, Minghan Qin, Yu Li, Haoqian Wang",cs.CV
Planar Disjoint Shortest Paths is Fixed-Parameter Tractable,"In the Disjoint Shortest Paths problem one is given a graph $G$ and a set $\mathcal{T}=\{(s_1,t_1),\dots,(s_k,t_k)\}$ of $k$ vertex pairs. The question is whether there exist vertex-disjoint paths $P_1,\dots,P_k$ in $G$ so that each $P_i$ is a shortest path between $s_i$ and $t_i$. While the problem is known to be W[1]-hard in general, we show that it is fixed-parameter tractable on planar graphs with positive edge weights. Specifically, we propose an algorithm for Planar Disjoint Shortest Paths with running time $2^{O(k\log k)}\cdot n^{O(1)}$. Notably, our parameter dependency is better than state-of-the-art $2^{O(k^2)}$ for the Planar Disjoint Paths problem, where the sought paths are not required to be shortest paths.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03353.pdf,"Micha{\l} Pilipczuk, Giannos Stamoulis, Micha{\l} W{\l}odarczyk",cs.DS
Effective Reinforcement Learning Control using Conservative Soft Actor-Critic,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great potential in complex control tasks, particularly when combined with deep neural networks within the Actor-Critic (AC) framework. However, in practical applications, balancing exploration, learning stability, and sample efficiency remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods such as Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) address these issues by incorporating entropy or relative entropy regularization, but often face problems of instability and low sample efficiency. In this paper, we propose the Conservative Soft Actor-Critic (CSAC) algorithm, which seamlessly integrates entropy and relative entropy regularization within the AC framework. CSAC improves exploration through entropy regularization while avoiding overly aggressive policy updates with the use of relative entropy regularization. Evaluations on benchmark tasks and real-world robotic simulations demonstrate that CSAC offers significant improvements in stability and efficiency over existing methods. These findings suggest that CSAC provides strong robustness and application potential in control tasks under dynamic environments.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03356.pdf,"Xinyi Yuan, Zhiwei Shang, Wenjun Huang, Yunduan Cui, Di Chen, Meixin Zhu",cs.RO
Domain Adversarial Training for Mitigating Gender Bias in Speech-based Mental Health Detection,"Speech-based AI models are emerging as powerful tools for detecting depression and the presence of Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), offering a non-invasive and cost-effective way to assess mental health. However, these models often struggle with gender bias, which can lead to unfair and inaccurate predictions. In this study, our study addresses this issue by introducing a domain adversarial training approach that explicitly considers gender differences in speech-based depression and PTSD detection. Specifically, we treat different genders as distinct domains and integrate this information into a pretrained speech foundation model. We then validate its effectiveness on the E-DAIC dataset to assess its impact on performance. Experimental results show that our method notably improves detection performance, increasing the F1-score by up to 13.29 percentage points compared to the baseline.

Hierarchical dynamic domain decomposition for the multiscale Boltzmann equation,"In this work, we present a hierarchical domain decomposition method for the multi-scale Boltzmann equation based on moment realizability matrices, a concept introduced by Levermore, Morokoff, and Nadiga in \cite{lev-mor-nad-1998}. This criterion is used to dynamically partition the two-dimensional spatial domain into three regimes: the Euler regime, an intermediate kinetic regime governed by the ES-BGK model, and the full Boltzmann regime. The key advantage of this approach lies in the use of Euler equations in regions where the flow is near hydrodynamic equilibrium, the ES-BGK model in moderately non-equilibrium regions where a fluid description is insufficient but full kinetic resolution is not yet necessary, and the full Boltzmann solver where strong non-equilibrium effects dominate, such as near shocks and boundary layers. This allows for both high accuracy and significant computational savings, as the Euler solver and the ES-BGK models are considerably cheaper than the full kinetic Boltzmann model.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03360.pdf,"Domenico Caparello, Lorenzo Pareschi, Thomas Rey",math.NA
Interpretable Zero-shot Learning with Infinite Class Concepts,"Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize unseen classes by aligning images with intermediate class semantics, like human-annotated concepts or class definitions. An emerging alternative leverages Large-scale Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate class documents. However, these methods often face challenges with transparency in the classification process and may suffer from the notorious hallucination problem in LLMs, resulting in non-visual class semantics. This paper redefines class semantics in ZSL with a focus on transferability and discriminability, introducing a novel framework called Zero-shot Learning with Infinite Class Concepts (InfZSL). Our approach leverages the powerful capabilities of LLMs to dynamically generate an unlimited array of phrase-level class concepts. To address the hallucination challenge, we introduce an entropy-based scoring process that incorporates a ``goodness"" concept selection mechanism, ensuring that only the most transferable and discriminative concepts are selected. Our InfZSL framework not only demonstrates significant improvements on three popular benchmark datasets but also generates highly interpretable, image-grounded concepts. Code will be released upon acceptance.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03361.pdf,"Zihan Ye, Shreyank N Gowda, Shiming Chen, Yaochu Jin, Kaizhu Huang, Xiaobo Jin",cs.CV
3D Surface Reconstruction with Enhanced High-Frequency Details,"Neural implicit 3D reconstruction can reproduce shapes without 3D supervision, and it learns the 3D scene through volume rendering methods and neural implicit representations. Current neural surface reconstruction methods tend to randomly sample the entire image, making it difficult to learn high-frequency details on the surface, and thus the reconstruction results tend to be too smooth. We designed a method (FreNeuS) based on high-frequency information to solve the problem of insufficient surface detail. Specifically, FreNeuS uses pixel gradient changes to easily acquire high-frequency regions in an image and uses the obtained high-frequency information to guide surface detail reconstruction. High-frequency information is first used to guide the dynamic sampling of rays, applying different sampling strategies according to variations in high-frequency regions. To further enhance the focus on surface details, we have designed a high-frequency weighting method that constrains the representation of high-frequency details during the reconstruction process. Qualitative and quantitative results show that our method can reconstruct fine surface details and obtain better surface reconstruction quality compared to existing methods. In addition, our method is more applicable and can be generalized to any NeuS-based work.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03362.pdf,"Shikun Zhang, Yiqun Wang, Cunjian Chen, Yong Li, Qiuhong Ke",cs.CV
DroidRetriever: An Autonomous Navigation and Information Integration System Facilitating Mobile Sensemaking,"Users regularly rely on mobile applications for their daily information needs, and mobile sensemaking is prevalent in various domains such as education, healthcare, business intelligence, and emergency response, where timely and context-aware information-processing and decision-making is critical. However, valuable information is often scattered across the closed ecosystems within various applications, posing challenges for traditional search engines to retrieve data openly and in real-time. Additionally, due to limitations such as mobile device screen sizes, language differences, and unfamiliarity with specific applications and domain knowledge, users have to frequently switch between multiple applications and spend substantial time locating and integrating the information. To address these challenges, we present DroidRetriever, a system for cross-application information retrieval to facilitate mobile sensemaking. DroidRetriever can automatically navigate to relevant interfaces based on users' natural language commands, capture screenshots, extract and integrate information, and finally present the results. Our experimental results demonstrate that DroidRetriever can extract and integrate information with near-human accuracy while significantly reducing processing time. Furthermore, with minimal user intervention, DroidRetriever effectively corrects and completes various information retrieval tasks, substantially reducing the user's workload. Our summary of the motivations for intervention and the discussion of their necessity provide valuable implications for future research. We will open-source our code upon acceptance of the paper.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03364.pdf,"Yiheng Bian, Yunpeng Song, Guiyu Ma, Rongrong Zhu, Zhongmin Cai",cs.HC
Geospatial Mechanistic Interpretability of Large Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities across various natural language processing tasks. Their ability to process and generate viable text and code has made them ubiquitous in many fields, while their deployment as knowledge bases and ""reasoning"" tools remains an area of ongoing research. In geography, a growing body of literature has been focusing on evaluating LLMs' geographical knowledge and their ability to perform spatial reasoning. However, very little is still known about the internal functioning of these models, especially about how they process geographical information.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03368.pdf,"Stef De Sabbata, Stefano Mizzaro, Kevin Roitero",cs.LG
Validating the Effectiveness of a Large Language Model-based Approach for Identifying Children's Development across Various Free Play Settings in Kindergarten,"Free play is a fundamental aspect of early childhood education, supporting children's cognitive, social, emotional, and motor development. However, assessing children's development during free play poses significant challenges due to the unstructured and spontaneous nature of the activity. Traditional assessment methods often rely on direct observations by teachers, parents, or researchers, which may fail to capture comprehensive insights from free play and provide timely feedback to educators. This study proposes an innovative approach combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with learning analytics to analyze children's self-narratives of their play experiences. The LLM identifies developmental abilities, while performance scores across different play settings are calculated using learning analytics techniques. We collected 2,224 play narratives from 29 children in a kindergarten, covering four distinct play areas over one semester. According to the evaluation results from eight professionals, the LLM-based approach achieved high accuracy in identifying cognitive, motor, and social abilities, with accuracy exceeding 90% in most domains. Moreover, significant differences in developmental outcomes were observed across play settings, highlighting each area's unique contributions to specific abilities. These findings confirm that the proposed approach is effective in identifying children's development across various free play settings. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs and learning analytics to provide child-centered insights into developmental trajectories, offering educators valuable data to support personalized learning and enhance early childhood education practices.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03369.pdf,"Yuanyuan Yang, Yuan Shen, Tianchen Sun, Yangbin Xie",cs.AI
GPU Implementation of the Wavelet Tree,"I present a new GPU implementation of the wavelet tree data structure. It includes binary rank and select support structures that provide at least 10 times higher throughput of binary rank and select queries than the best publicly available CPU implementations at comparable storage overhead. My work also presents a new parallel tree construction algorithm that, when excluding the time to copy the data from the CPU to the GPU, outperforms the current state of the art. The GPU implementation, given enough parallelism, processes access, rank, and select queries at least 2x faster than the wavelet tree implementation contained in the widely used Succinct Data Structure Library (SDSL), including the time necessary to copy the queries from the CPU to the GPU and the results back to the CPU from the GPU.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03372.pdf,"Marco Franzreb, Martin Burtscher, Stephan Rudolph",cs.DS
SPAP: Structured Pruning via Alternating Optimization and Penalty Methods,"The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by their substantial computational and memory demands. While structured pruning presents a viable approach by eliminating entire network components, existing methods suffer from performance degradation, reliance on heuristic metrics, or expensive finetuning. To address these challenges, we propose SPAP (Structured Pruning via Alternating Optimization and Penalty Methods), a novel and efficient structured pruning framework for LLMs grounded in optimization theory. SPAP formulates the pruning problem through a mixed-integer optimization model, employs a penalty method that effectively makes pruning decisions to minimize pruning errors, and introduces an alternating minimization algorithm tailored to the splittable problem structure for efficient weight updates and performance recovery. Extensive experiments on OPT, LLaMA-3/3.1/3.2, and Qwen2.5 models demonstrate SPAP's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, delivering linear inference speedups (1.29$\times$ at 30% sparsity) and proportional memory reductions. Our work offers a practical, optimization-driven solution for pruning LLMs while preserving model performance.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03373.pdf,"Hanyu Hu, Xiaoming Yuan",cs.LG
Reducing Annotation Burden in Physical Activity Research Using Vision-Language Models,"Introduction: Data from wearable devices collected in free-living settings, and labelled with physical activity behaviours compatible with health research, are essential for both validating existing wearable-based measurement approaches and developing novel machine learning approaches. One common way of obtaining these labels relies on laborious annotation of sequences of images captured by cameras worn by participants through the course of a day. Methods: We compare the performance of three vision language models and two discriminative models on two free-living validation studies with 161 and 111 participants, collected in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom and Sichuan, China, respectively, using the Autographer (OMG Life, defunct) wearable camera. Results: We found that the best open-source vision-language model (VLM) and fine-tuned discriminative model (DM) achieved comparable performance when predicting sedentary behaviour from single images on unseen participants in the Oxfordshire study; median F1-scores: VLM = 0.89 (0.84, 0.92), DM = 0.91 (0.86, 0.95). Performance declined for light (VLM = 0.60 (0.56,0.67), DM = 0.70 (0.63, 0.79)), and moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (VLM = 0.66 (0.53, 0.85); DM = 0.72 (0.58, 0.84)). When applied to the external Sichuan study, performance fell across all intensity categories, with median Cohen's kappa-scores falling from 0.54 (0.49, 0.64) to 0.26 (0.15, 0.37) for the VLM, and from 0.67 (0.60, 0.74) to 0.19 (0.10, 0.30) for the DM. Conclusion: Freely available computer vision models could help annotate sedentary behaviour, typically the most prevalent activity of daily living, from wearable camera images within similar populations to seen data, reducing the annotation burden.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03374.pdf,"Abram Schonfeldt, Benjamin Maylor, Xiaofang Chen, Ronald Clark, Aiden Doherty",cs.CV
Efficient Wi-Fi Sensing for IoT Forensics with Lossy Compression of CSI Data,"Wi-Fi sensing is an emerging technology that uses channel state information (CSI) from ambient Wi-Fi signals to monitor human activity without the need for dedicated sensors. Wi-Fi sensing does not only represent a pivotal technology in intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) systems, but it can also provide valuable insights in forensic investigations. However, the high dimensionality of CSI data presents major challenges for storage, transmission, and processing in resource-constrained IoT environments. In this paper, we investigate the impact of lossy compression on the accuracy of Wi-Fi sensing, evaluating both traditional techniques and a deep learning-based approach. Our results reveal that simple, interpretable techniques based on principal component analysis can significantly reduce the CSI data volume while preserving classification performance, making them highly suitable for lightweight IoT forensic scenarios. On the other hand, deep learning models exhibit higher potential in complex applications like activity recognition (achieving compression ratios up to 16000:1 with minimal impact on sensing performance) but require careful tuning and greater computational resources. By considering two different sensing applications, this work demonstrates the feasibility of integrating lossy compression schemes into Wi-Fi sensing pipelines to make intelligent IoT systems more efficient and improve the storage requirements in forensic applications.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03375.pdf,"Paolo Cerutti, Fabio Palmese, Marco Cominelli, Alessandro E.

Tell Me the Good Stuff: User Preferences in Movie Recommendation Explanations,"Recommender systems play a vital role in helping users discover content in streaming services, but their effectiveness depends on users understanding why items are recommended. In this study, explanations were based solely on item features rather than personalized data, simulating recommendation scenarios. We compared user perceptions of one-sided (purely positive) and two-sided (positive and negative) feature-based explanations for popular movie recommendations. Through an online study with 129 participants, we examined how explanation style affected perceived trust, transparency, effectiveness, and satisfaction. One-sided explanations consistently received higher ratings across all dimensions. Our findings suggest that in low-stakes entertainment domains such as popular movie recommendations, simpler positive explanations may be more effective. However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to potential confounding factors such as item familiarity and the placement of negative information in explanations. This work provides practical insights for explanation design in recommender interfaces and highlights the importance of context in shaping user preferences.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03376.pdf,"Juan Ahmad, Jonas Hellgren, Alan Said",cs.IR
Reinforced Correlation Between Vision and Language for Precise Medical AI Assistant,"Medical AI assistants support doctors in disease diagnosis, medical image analysis, and report generation. However, they still face significant challenges in clinical use, including limited accuracy with multimodal content and insufficient validation in real-world settings. We propose RCMed, a full-stack AI assistant that improves multimodal alignment in both input and output, enabling precise anatomical delineation, accurate localization, and reliable diagnosis through hierarchical vision-language grounding. A self-reinforcing correlation mechanism allows visual features to inform language context, while language semantics guide pixel-wise attention, forming a closed loop that refines both modalities. This correlation is enhanced by a color region description strategy, translating anatomical structures into semantically rich text to learn shape-location-text relationships across scales. Trained on 20 million image-mask-description triplets, RCMed achieves state-of-the-art precision in contextualizing irregular lesions and subtle anatomical boundaries, excelling in 165 clinical tasks across 9 modalities. It achieved a 23.5% relative improvement in cell segmentation from microscopy images over prior methods. RCMed's strong vision-language alignment enables exceptional generalization, with state-of-the-art performance in external validation across 20 clinically significant cancer types, including novel tasks. This work demonstrates how integrated multimodal models capture fine-grained patterns, enabling human-level interpretation in complex scenarios and advancing human-centric AI healthcare.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03380.pdf,"Haonan Wang, Jiaji Mao, Lehan Wang, Qixiang Zhang, Marawan Elbatel, Yi Qin, Huijun Hu, Baoxun Li, Wenhui Deng, Weifeng Qin, Hongrui Li, Jialin Liang, Jun Shen, Xiaomeng Li",cs.CV
Physics-informed neural network estimation of active material properties in time-dependent cardiac biomechanical models,"Active stress models in cardiac biomechanics account for the mechanical deformation caused by muscle activity, thus providing a link between the electrophysiological and mechanical properties of the tissue. The accurate assessment of active stress parameters is fundamental for a precise understanding of myocardial function but remains difficult to achieve in a clinical setting, especially when only displacement and strain data from medical imaging modalities are available. This work investigates, through an in-silico study, the application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for inferring active contractility parameters in time-dependent cardiac biomechanical models from these types of imaging data. In particular, by parametrising the sought state and parameter field with two neural networks, respectively, and formulating an energy minimisation problem to search for the optimal network parameters, we are able to reconstruct in various settings active stress fields in the presence of noise and with a high spatial resolution. To this end, we also advance the vanilla PINN learning algorithm with the use of adaptive weighting schemes, ad-hoc regularisation strategies, Fourier features, and suitable network architectures. In addition, we thoroughly analyse the influence of the loss weights in the reconstruction of active stress parameters. Finally, we apply the method to the characterisation of tissue inhomogeneities and detection of fibrotic scars in myocardial tissue. This approach opens a new pathway to significantly improve the diagnosis, treatment planning, and management of heart conditions associated with cardiac fibrosis.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03382.pdf,"Matthias H\""ofler, Francesco Regazzoni, Stefano Pagani, Elias Karabelas, Christoph Augustin, Gundolf Haase, Gernot Plank, Federica Caforio",cs.LG
Attention-aggregated Attack for Boosting the Transferability of Facial Adversarial Examples,"Adversarial examples have revealed the vulnerability of deep learning models and raised serious concerns about information security. The transfer-based attack is a hot topic in black-box attacks that are practical to real-world scenarios where the training datasets, parameters, and structure of the target model are unknown to the attacker. However, few methods consider the particularity of class-specific deep models for fine-grained vision tasks, such as face recognition (FR), giving rise to unsatisfactory attacking performance. In this work, we first investigate what in a face exactly contributes to the embedding learning of FR models and find that both decisive and auxiliary facial features are specific to each FR model, which is quite different from the biological mechanism of human visual system. Accordingly we then propose a novel attack method named Attention-aggregated Attack (AAA) to enhance the transferability of adversarial examples against FR, which is inspired by the attention divergence and aims to destroy the facial features that are critical for the decision-making of other FR models by imitating their attentions on the clean face images. Extensive experiments conducted on various FR models validate the superiority and robust effectiveness of the proposed method over existing methods.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03383.pdf,"Jian-Wei Li, Wen-Ze Shao",cs.CV
Improving Omics-Based Classification: The Role of Feature Selection and Synthetic Data Generation,"Given the increasing complexity of omics datasets, a key challenge is not only improving classification performance but also enhancing the transparency and reliability of model decisions. Effective model performance and feature selection are fundamental for explainability and reliability. In many cases, high dimensional omics datasets suffer from limited number of samples due to clinical constraints, patient conditions, phenotypes rarity and others conditions. Current omics based classification models often suffer from narrow interpretability, making it difficult to discern meaningful insights where trust and reproducibility are critical. This study presents a machine learning based classification framework that integrates feature selection with data augmentation techniques to achieve high standard classification accuracy while ensuring better interpretability. Using the publicly available dataset (E MTAB 8026), we explore a bootstrap analysis in six binary classification scenarios to evaluate the proposed model's behaviour. We show that the proposed pipeline yields cross validated perfomance on small dataset that is conserved when the trained classifier is applied to a larger test set. Our findings emphasize the fundamental balance between accuracy and feature selection, highlighting the positive effect of introducing synthetic data for better generalization, even in scenarios with very limited samples availability.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03387.pdf,"Diego Perazzolo, Pietro Fanton, Ilaria Barison, Marny Fedrigo, Annalisa Angelini, Chiara Castellani, Enrico Grisan",cs.LG
Concept Factorization via Self-Representation and Adaptive Graph Structure Learning,"Concept Factorization (CF) models have attracted widespread attention due to their excellent performance in data clustering. In recent years, many variant models based on CF have achieved great success in clustering by taking into account the internal geometric manifold structure of the dataset and using graph regularization techniques. However, their clustering performance depends greatly on the construction of the initial graph structure. In order to enable adaptive learning of the graph structure of the data, we propose a Concept Factorization Based on Self-Representation and Adaptive Graph Structure Learning (CFSRAG) Model. CFSRAG learns the affinity relationship between data through a self-representation method, and uses the learned affinity matrix to implement dynamic graph regularization constraints, thereby ensuring dynamic learning of the internal geometric structure of the data. Finally, we give the CFSRAG update rule and convergence analysis, and conduct comparative experiments on four real datasets. The results show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art models.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03390.pdf,"Zhengqin Yang, Di Wu, Jia Chen, Xin Luo",cs.LG
Truthful Facility Location with Candidate Locations and Limited Resources,"We study a truthful facility location problem where one out of $k\geq2$ available facilities must be built at a location chosen from a set of candidate ones in the interval $[0,1]$. This decision aims to accommodate a set of agents with private positions in $[0,1]$ and approval preferences over the facilities; the agents act strategically and may misreport their private information to maximize their utility, which depends on the chosen facility and their distance from it. We focus on strategyproof mechanisms that incentivize the agents to act truthfully and bound the best possible approximation of the optimal social welfare (the total utility of the agents) they can achieve. We first show that deterministic mechanisms have unbounded approximation ratio, and then present a randomized mechanism with approximation ratio $k$, which is tight even when agents may only misreport their positions. For the restricted setting where agents may only misreport their approval preferences, we design a deterministic mechanism with approximation ratio of roughly $2.325$, and establish lower bounds of $3/2$ and $6/5$ for deterministic and randomized mechanisms, respectively.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03391.pdf,"Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, Alexandros A.

Automatic Calibration for Membership Inference Attack on Large Language Models,"Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) have recently been employed to determine whether a specific text was part of the pre-training data of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods often misinfer non-members as members, leading to a high false positive rate, or depend on additional reference models for probability calibration, which limits their practicality. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel framework called Automatic Calibration Membership Inference Attack (ACMIA), which utilizes a tunable temperature to calibrate output probabilities effectively. This approach is inspired by our theoretical insights into maximum likelihood estimation during the pre-training of LLMs. We introduce ACMIA in three configurations designed to accommodate different levels of model access and increase the probability gap between members and non-members, improving the reliability and robustness of membership inference. Extensive experiments on various open-source LLMs demonstrate that our proposed attack is highly effective, robust, and generalizable, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines across three widely used benchmarks. Our code is available at: \href{https://github.com/Salehzz/ACMIA}{\textcolor{blue}{Github}}.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03392.pdf,"Saleh Zare Zade, Yao Qiang, Xiangyu Zhou, Hui Zhu, Mohammad Amin Roshani, Prashant Khanduri, Dongxiao Zhu",cs.LG
Prediction Models That Learn to Avoid Missing Values,"Handling missing values at test time is challenging for machine learning models, especially when aiming for both high accuracy and interpretability. Established approaches often add bias through imputation or excessive model complexity via missingness indicators. Moreover, either method can obscure interpretability, making it harder to understand how the model utilizes the observed variables in predictions. We propose missingness-avoiding (MA) machine learning, a general framework for training models to rarely require the values of missing (or imputed) features at test time. We create tailored MA learning algorithms for decision trees, tree ensembles, and sparse linear models by incorporating classifier-specific regularization terms in their learning objectives. The tree-based models leverage contextual missingness by reducing reliance on missing values based on the observed context. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MA-DT, MA-LASSO, MA-RF, and MA-GBT effectively reduce the reliance on features with missing values while maintaining predictive performance competitive with their unregularized counterparts. This shows that our framework gives practitioners a powerful tool to maintain interpretability in predictions with test-time missing values.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03393.pdf,"Lena Stempfle, Anton Matsson, Newton Mwai, Fredrik D.

EOPose : Exemplar-based object reposing using Generalized Pose Correspondences,"Reposing objects in images has a myriad of applications, especially for e-commerce where several variants of product images need to be produced quickly. In this work, we leverage the recent advances in unsupervised keypoint correspondence detection between different object images of the same class to propose an end-to-end framework for generic object reposing. Our method, EOPose, takes a target pose-guidance image as input and uses its keypoint correspondence with the source object image to warp and re-render the latter into the target pose using a novel three-step approach. Unlike generative approaches, our method also preserves the fine-grained details of the object such as its exact colors, textures, and brand marks. We also prepare a new dataset of paired objects based on the Objaverse dataset to train and test our network. EOPose produces high-quality reposing output as evidenced by different image quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM and FID). Besides a description of the method and the dataset, the paper also includes detailed ablation and user studies to indicate the efficacy of the proposed method",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03394.pdf,"Sarthak Mehrotra, Rishabh Jain, Mayur Hemani, Balaji Krishnamurthy, Mausoom Sarkar",cs.CV
Benchmark-based Study of CPU/GPU Power-Related Features through JAX and TensorFlow,"Power management has become a crucial focus in the modern computing landscape, considering that {\em energy} is increasingly recognized as a critical resource. This increased the importance of all topics related to {\em energy-aware computing}. This paper presents an experimental study of three prevalent power management techniques that are {\em power limitation, frequency limitation}, and {\em ACPI/P-State governor modes} (OS states related to power consumption). Through a benchmark approach with a set of six computing kernels, we investigate {\em power/performance} trade-off with various hardware units and software frameworks (mainly TensorFlow and JAX). Our experimental results show that {\em frequency limitation} is the most effective technique to improve {\em Energy-Delay Product (EDP)}, which is a convolution of energy and running time. We also observe that running at the highest frequency compared to a reduced one could lead to a reduction of factor $\frac{1}{10}$ in EDP. Another noticeable fact is that frequency management shows a consistent behavior with different CPUs, whereas opposite effects sometimes occur between TensorFlow (TF) and JAX with the same power management settings.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03398.pdf,"Roblex Nana Tchakoute, Claude Tadonki, Petr Dokladal, Youssef Mesri",cs.PF
Close-Fitting Dressing Assistance Based on State Estimation of Feet and Garments with Semantic-based Visual Attention,"As the population continues to age, a shortage of caregivers is expected in the future. Dressing assistance, in particular, is crucial for opportunities for social participation. Especially dressing close-fitting garments, such as socks, remains challenging due to the need for fine force adjustments to handle the friction or snagging against the skin, while considering the shape and position of the garment. This study introduces a method uses multi-modal information including not only robot's camera images, joint angles, joint torques, but also tactile forces for proper force interaction that can adapt to individual differences in humans. Furthermore, by introducing semantic information based on object concepts, rather than relying solely on RGB data, it can be generalized to unseen feet and background. In addition, incorporating depth data helps infer relative spatial relationship between the sock and the foot. To validate its capability for semantic object conceptualization and to ensure safety, training data were collected using a mannequin, and subsequent experiments were conducted with human subjects. In experiments, the robot successfully adapted to previously unseen human feet and was able to put socks on 10 participants, achieving a higher success rate than Action Chunking with Transformer and Diffusion Policy. These results demonstrate that the proposed model can estimate the state of both the garment and the foot, enabling precise dressing assistance for close-fitting garments.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03400.pdf,"Takuma Tsukakoshi, Tamon Miyake, Tetsuya Ogata, Yushi Wang, Takumi Akaishi, Shigeki Sugano",cs.RO
DDaTR: Dynamic Difference-aware Temporal Residual Network for Longitudinal Radiology Report Generation,"Radiology Report Generation (RRG) automates the creation of radiology reports from medical imaging, enhancing the efficiency of the reporting process. Longitudinal Radiology Report Generation (LRRG) extends RRG by incorporating the ability to compare current and prior exams, facilitating the tracking of temporal changes in clinical findings. Existing LRRG approaches only extract features from prior and current images using a visual pre-trained encoder, which are then concatenated to generate the final report. However, these methods struggle to effectively capture both spatial and temporal correlations during the feature extraction process. Consequently, the extracted features inadequately capture the information of difference across exams and thus underrepresent the expected progressions, leading to sub-optimal performance in LRRG. To address this, we develop a novel dynamic difference-aware temporal residual network (DDaTR). In DDaTR, we introduce two modules at each stage of the visual encoder to capture multi-level spatial correlations. The Dynamic Feature Alignment Module (DFAM) is designed to align prior features across modalities for the integrity of prior clinical information. Prompted by the enriched prior features, the dynamic difference-aware module (DDAM) captures favorable difference information by identifying relationships across exams. Furthermore, our DDaTR employs the dynamic residual network to unidirectionally transmit longitudinal information, effectively modelling temporal correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrated superior performance over existing methods on three benchmarks, proving its efficacy in both RRG and LRRG tasks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03401.pdf,"Shanshan Song, Hui Tang, Honglong Yang, Xiaomeng Li",cs.CV

This paper details the system's technical components, including its architecture, quantization methods, and key healthcare applications such as enhanced disease prediction from patient symptoms and medical history, treatment suggestions, and efficient summarization of complex medical reports. We touch on the ethical considerations-patient privacy, data security, and the need for rigorous clinical validation-as well as the practical challenges of integrating such systems into real-world healthcare workflows. Furthermore, the lightweight quantized weights ensure scalability and ease of deployment even in low-resource hospital environments. Finally, the paper concludes with an analysis of the broader impact of LLMs on healthcare and outlines future directions for LLMs in medical settings.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03406.pdf,"Mohammad Shoaib Ansari, Mohd Sohail Ali Khan, Shubham Revankar, Aditya Varma, Anil S.

CB-cPIR: Code-Based Computational Private Information Retrieval,"A private information retrieval (PIR) scheme is a protocol that allows a user to retrieve a file from a database without revealing the identity of the desired file to a curious database. Given a distributed data storage system, efficient PIR can be achieved by making assumptions about the colluding capabilities of the storage servers holding the database. If these assumptions turn out to be incorrect, privacy is lost. In this work, we focus on the worst-case assumption: full collusion or, equivalently, viewing the storage system virtually as a single honest-but-curious server. We present CB-cPIR, a single-server code-based computational private information retrieval (cPIR) scheme that derives security from code-based cryptography. Specifically, the queries are protected by the hardness of decoding a random linear code. The scheme is heavily inspired by the pioneering code-based cPIR scheme proposed by Holzbaur, Hollanti, and Wachter-Zeh in [Holzbaur et al., ""Computational Code-Based Single-Server Private Information Retrieval"", 2020 IEEE ISIT] and fixes the vulnerabilities of the original scheme arising from highly probable rank differences in submatrices of the user's query. For further validation, we draw comparisons to the state-of-the-art lattice-based cPIR schemes.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03407.pdf,"Camilla Hollanti, Neehar Verma",cs.IR

CXR-AD: Component X-ray Image Dataset for Industrial Anomaly Detection,"Internal defect detection constitutes a critical process in ensuring component quality, for which anomaly detection serves as an effective solution. However, existing anomaly detection datasets predominantly focus on surface defects in visible-light images, lacking publicly available X-ray datasets targeting internal defects in components. To address this gap, we construct the first publicly accessible component X-ray anomaly detection (CXR-AD) dataset, comprising real-world X-ray images. The dataset covers five industrial component categories, including 653 normal samples and 561 defect samples with precise pixel-level mask annotations. We systematically analyze the dataset characteristics and identify three major technical challenges: (1) strong coupling between complex internal structures and defect regions, (2) inherent low contrast and high noise interference in X-ray imaging, and (3) significant variations in defect scales and morphologies. To evaluate dataset complexity, we benchmark three state-of-the-art anomaly detection frameworks (feature-based, reconstruction-based, and zero-shot learning methods). Experimental results demonstrate a 29.78% average performance degradation on CXR-AD compared to MVTec AD, highlighting the limitations of current algorithms in handling internal defect detection tasks. To the best of our knowledge, CXR-AD represents the first publicly available X-ray dataset for component anomaly detection, providing a real-world industrial benchmark to advance algorithm development and enhance precision in internal defect inspection technologies.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03412.pdf,"Haoyu Bai, Jie Wang, Gaomin Li, Xuan Li, Xiaohu Zhang, Xia Yang",cs.CV
Enhancing Target-unspecific Tasks through a Features Matrix,"Recent developments in prompt learning of large vision-language models have significantly improved performance in target-specific tasks. However, these prompt optimizing methods often struggle to tackle the target-unspecific or generalizable tasks effectively. It may be attributed to the fact that overfitting training causes the model to forget its general knowledge having strong promotion on target-unspecific tasks. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel Features Matrix (FM) regularization approach designed to enhance these models on target-unspecific tasks. Our method extracts and leverages general knowledge, shaping a Features Matrix (FM). Specifically, the FM captures the semantics of diverse inputs from a deep and fine perspective, preserving essential general knowledge, which mitigates the risk of overfitting. Representative evaluations demonstrate that: 1) the FM is compatible with existing frameworks as a generic and flexible module, and 2) the FM significantly showcases its effectiveness in enhancing target-unspecific tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03414.pdf,"Fangming Cui, Yonggang Zhang, Xuan Wang, Xinmei Tian, Jun Yu",cs.CV
Data-efficient inverse design of spinodoid metamaterials,"We create an data-efficient and accurate surrogate model for structure-property linkages of spinodoid metamaterials with only 75 data points -- far fewer than the several thousands used in prior works -- and demonstrate its use in multi-objective inverse design. The inverse problem of finding a material microstructure that leads to given bulk properties is of great interest in mechanics and materials science. These inverse design tasks often require a large dataset, which can become unaffordable when considering material behavior that requires more expensive simulations or experiments. We generate a data-efficient surrogate for the mapping between the characteristics of the local material structure and the effective elasticity tensor and use it to inversely design structures with multiple objectives simultaneously. The presented neural network-based surrogate model achieves its data efficiency by inherently satisfying certain requirements, such as equivariance with respect to permutations of structure parameters, which avoids having to learn them from data. The resulting surrogate of the forward model is differentiable, allowing its direct use in gradient-based optimization for the inverse design problem. We demonstrate in three inverse design tasks of varying complexity that this approach yields reliable results while requiring significantly less training data than previous approaches based on neural-network surrogates. This paves the way for inverse design involving nonlinear mechanical behavior, where data efficiency is currently the limiting factor.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03415.pdf,"Max Rosenkranz, Markus K\""astner, Ivo F.

Knowledge Augmented Complex Problem Solving with Large Language Models: A Survey,"Problem-solving has been a fundamental driver of human progress in numerous domains. With advancements in artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools capable of tackling complex problems across diverse domains. Unlike traditional computational systems, LLMs combine raw computational power with an approximation of human reasoning, allowing them to generate solutions, make inferences, and even leverage external computational tools. However, applying LLMs to real-world problem-solving presents significant challenges, including multi-step reasoning, domain knowledge integration, and result verification. This survey explores the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in complex problem-solving, examining techniques including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, knowledge augmentation, and various LLM-based and tool-based verification techniques. Additionally, we highlight domain-specific challenges in various domains, such as software engineering, mathematical reasoning and proving, data analysis and modeling, and scientific research. The paper further discusses the fundamental limitations of the current LLM solutions and the future directions of LLM-based complex problems solving from the perspective of multi-step reasoning, domain knowledge integration and result verification.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03418.pdf,"Da Zheng, Lun Du, Junwei Su, Yuchen Tian, Yuqi Zhu, Jintian Zhang, Lanning Wei, Ningyu Zhang, Huajun Chen",cs.LG
A practical algorithm for 2-admissibility,"The $2$-admissibility of a graph is a promising measure to identify real-world networks which have an algorithmically favourable structure. In contrast to other related measures, like the weak/strong $2$-colouring numbers or the maximum density of graphs that appear as $1$-subdivisions, the $2$-admissibility can be computed in polynomial time. However, so far these results are theoretical only and no practical implementation to compute the $2$-admissibility exists.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03419.pdf,"Christine Awofeso, Patrick Greaves, Oded Lachish, Felix Reidl",cs.DS
Mitigating Image Captioning Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models,"Hallucinations in vision-language models (VLMs) hinder reliability and real-world applicability, usually stemming from distribution shifts between pretraining data and test samples. Existing solutions, such as retraining or fine-tuning on additional data, demand significant computational resources and labor-intensive data collection, while ensemble-based methods incur additional costs by introducing auxiliary VLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel test-time adaptation framework using reinforcement learning to mitigate hallucinations during inference without retraining or any auxiliary VLMs. By updating only the learnable parameters in the layer normalization of the language model (approximately 0.003% of the model parameters), our method reduces distribution shifts between test samples and pretraining samples. A CLIP-based hallucination evaluation model is proposed to provide dual rewards to VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate a 15.4% and 17.3% reduction in hallucination rates on LLaVA and InstructBLIP, respectively. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a 68.3% improvement in hallucination mitigation, demonstrating its effectiveness.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03420.pdf,"Fei Zhao, Chengcui Zhang, Runlin Zhang, Tianyang Wang, Xi Li",cs.MM
LiftFeat: 3D Geometry-Aware Local Feature Matching,"Robust and efficient local feature matching plays a crucial role in applications such as SLAM and visual localization for robotics. Despite great progress, it is still very challenging to extract robust and discriminative visual features in scenarios with drastic lighting changes, low texture areas, or repetitive patterns. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight network called \textit{LiftFeat}, which lifts the robustness of raw descriptor by aggregating 3D geometric feature. Specifically, we first adopt a pre-trained monocular depth estimation model to generate pseudo surface normal label, supervising the extraction of 3D geometric feature in terms of predicted surface normal. We then design a 3D geometry-aware feature lifting module to fuse surface normal feature with raw 2D descriptor feature. Integrating such 3D geometric feature enhances the discriminative ability of 2D feature description in extreme conditions. Extensive experimental results on relative pose estimation, homography estimation, and visual localization tasks, demonstrate that our LiftFeat outperforms some lightweight state-of-the-art methods. Code will be released at : https://github.com/lyp-deeplearning/LiftFeat.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03422.pdf,"Yepeng Liu, Wenpeng Lai, Zhou Zhao, Yuxuan Xiong, Jinchi Zhu, Jun Cheng, Yongchao Xu",cs.CV
AI-Based Feedback in Counselling Competence Training of Prospective Teachers,"This study explores the use of AI-based feedback to enhance the counselling competence of prospective teachers. An iterative block seminar was designed, incorporating theoretical foundations, practical applications, and AI tools for analysing verbal, paraverbal, and nonverbal communication. The seminar included recorded simulated teacher-parent conversations, followed by AI-based feedback and qualitative interviews with students. The study investigated correlations between communication characteristics and conversation quality, student perceptions of AI-based feedback, and the training of AI models to identify conversation phases and techniques. Results indicated significant correlations between nonverbal and paraverbal features and conversation quality, and students positively perceived the AI feedback. The findings suggest that AI-based feedback can provide objective, actionable insights to improve teacher training programs. Future work will focus on refining verbal skill annotations, expanding the dataset, and exploring additional features to enhance the feedback system.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03423.pdf,"Tobias Hallmen, Kathrin Gietl, Karoline Hillesheim, Moritz Bauermann, Annemarie Friedrich, Elisabeth Andr\'e",cs.HC
Framework GNN-AID: Graph Neural Network Analysis Interpretation and Defense,"The growing need for Trusted AI (TAI) highlights the importance of interpretability and robustness in machine learning models. However, many existing tools overlook graph data and rarely combine these two aspects into a single solution. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a popular approach, achieving top results across various tasks. We introduce GNN-AID (Graph Neural Network Analysis, Interpretation, and Defense), an open-source framework designed for graph data to address this gap. Built as a Python library, GNN-AID supports advanced trust methods and architectural layers, allowing users to analyze graph datasets and GNN behavior using attacks, defenses, and interpretability methods.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03424.pdf,"Kirill Lukyanov, Mikhail Drobyshevskiy, Georgii Sazonov, Mikhail Soloviov, Ilya Makarov",cs.LG
Directed Greybox Fuzzing via Large Language Model,"Directed greybox fuzzing (DGF) focuses on efficiently reaching specific program locations or triggering particular behaviors, making it essential for tasks like vulnerability detection and crash reproduction. However, existing methods often suffer from path explosion and randomness in input mutation, leading to inefficiencies in exploring and exploiting target paths. In this paper, we propose HGFuzzer, an automatic framework that leverages the large language model (LLM) to address these challenges. HGFuzzer transforms path constraint problems into targeted code generation tasks, systematically generating test harnesses and reachable inputs to reduce unnecessary exploration paths significantly. Additionally, we implement custom mutators designed specifically for target functions, minimizing randomness and improving the precision of directed fuzzing. We evaluated HGFuzzer on 20 real-world vulnerabilities, successfully triggering 17, including 11 within the first minute, achieving a speedup of at least 24.8x compared to state-of-the-art directed fuzzers. Furthermore, HGFuzzer discovered 9 previously unknown vulnerabilities, all of which were assigned CVE IDs, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in identifying real-world vulnerabilities.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03425.pdf,"Hanxiang Xu, Yanjie Zhao, Haoyu Wang",cs.CR
Phenotype-Guided Generative Model for High-Fidelity Cardiac MRI Synthesis: Advancing Pretraining and Clinical Applications,"Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is a vital non-invasive tool for diagnosing heart diseases and evaluating cardiac health. However, the limited availability of large-scale, high-quality CMR datasets poses a major challenge to the effective application of artificial intelligence (AI) in this domain. Even the amount of unlabeled data and the health status it covers are difficult to meet the needs of model pretraining, which hinders the performance of AI models on downstream tasks. In this study, we present Cardiac Phenotype-Guided CMR Generation (CPGG), a novel approach for generating diverse CMR data that covers a wide spectrum of cardiac health status. The CPGG framework consists of two stages: in the first stage, a generative model is trained using cardiac phenotypes derived from CMR data; in the second stage, a masked autoregressive diffusion model, conditioned on these phenotypes, generates high-fidelity CMR cine sequences that capture both structural and functional features of the heart in a fine-grained manner. We synthesized a massive amount of CMR to expand the pretraining data. Experimental results show that CPGG generates high-quality synthetic CMR data, significantly improving performance on various downstream tasks, including diagnosis and cardiac phenotypes prediction. These gains are demonstrated across both public and private datasets, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

MedArabiQ: Benchmarking Large Language Models on Arabic Medical Tasks,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant promise for various applications in healthcare. However, their efficacy in the Arabic medical domain remains unexplored due to the lack of high-quality domain-specific datasets and benchmarks. This study introduces MedArabiQ, a novel benchmark dataset consisting of seven Arabic medical tasks, covering multiple specialties and including multiple choice questions, fill-in-the-blank, and patient-doctor question answering. We first constructed the dataset using past medical exams and publicly available datasets. We then introduced different modifications to evaluate various LLM capabilities, including bias mitigation. We conducted an extensive evaluation with five state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5. Our findings highlight the need for the creation of new high-quality benchmarks that span different languages to ensure fair deployment and scalability of LLMs in healthcare. By establishing this benchmark and releasing the dataset, we provide a foundation for future research aimed at evaluating and enhancing the multilingual capabilities of LLMs for the equitable use of generative AI in healthcare.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03427.pdf,"Mouath Abu Daoud, Chaimae Abouzahir, Leen Kharouf, Walid Al-Eisawi, Nizar Habash, Farah E.

Airdrop Games,"Launching a new blockchain system or application is frequently facilitated by a so called airdrop, where the system designer chooses a pre-existing set of potentially interested parties and allocates newly minted tokens to them with the expectation that they will participate in the system - such engagement, especially if it is of significant level, facilitates the system and raises its value and also the value of its newly minted token, hence benefiting the airdrop recipients. A number of challenging questions befuddle designers in this setting, such as how to choose the set of interested parties and how to allocate tokens to them. To address these considerations we put forward a game-theoretic model for such airdrop games. Our model can be used to guide the designer's choices based on the way the system's value depends on participation (modeled by a ''technology function'' in our framework) and the costs that participants incur. We identify both bad and good equilibria and identify the settings and the choices that can be made where the designer can influence the players towards good equilibria in an expedient manner.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03428.pdf,"Sotiris Georganas, Aggelos Kiayias, Paolo Penna",cs.GT
A Fusion-Guided Inception Network for Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution,"The fusion of low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (HSIs) with high-spatial-resolution conventional images (e.g., panchromatic or RGB) has played a significant role in recent advancements in HSI super-resolution. However, this fusion process relies on the availability of precise alignment between image pairs, which is often challenging in real-world scenarios. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a single-image super-resolution model called the Fusion-Guided Inception Network (FGIN). Specifically, we first employ a spectral-spatial fusion module to effectively integrate spectral and spatial information at an early stage. Next, an Inception-like hierarchical feature extraction strategy is used to capture multiscale spatial dependencies, followed by a dedicated multi-scale fusion block. To further enhance reconstruction quality, we incorporate an optimized upsampling module that combines bilinear interpolation with depthwise separable convolutions. Experimental evaluations on two publicly available hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our method.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03431.pdf,"Usman Muhammad, Jorma Laaksonen",cs.CV
Wasserstein Convergence of Score-based Generative Models under Semiconvexity and Discontinuous Gradients,"Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) approximate a data distribution by perturbing it with Gaussian noise and subsequently denoising it via a learned reverse diffusion process. These models excel at modeling complex data distributions and generating diverse samples, achieving state-of-the-art performance across domains such as computer vision, audio generation, reinforcement learning, and computational biology. Despite their empirical success, existing Wasserstein-2 convergence analysis typically assume strong regularity conditions-such as smoothness or strict log-concavity of the data distribution-that are rarely satisfied in practice. In this work, we establish the first non-asymptotic Wasserstein-2 convergence guarantees for SGMs targeting semiconvex distributions with potentially discontinuous gradients. Our upper bounds are explicit and sharp in key parameters, achieving optimal dependence of $O(\sqrt{d})$ on the data dimension $d$ and convergence rate of order one. The framework accommodates a wide class of practically relevant distributions, including symmetric modified half-normal distributions, Gaussian mixtures, double-well potentials, and elastic net potentials. By leveraging semiconvexity without requiring smoothness assumptions on the potential such as differentiability, our results substantially broaden the theoretical foundations of SGMs, bridging the gap between empirical success and rigorous guarantees in non-smooth, complex data regimes.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03432.pdf,"Stefano Bruno, Sotirios Sabanis",cs.LG
Procedural Memory Is Not All You Need: Bridging Cognitive Gaps in LLM-Based Agents,"Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a landmark achievement in Artificial Intelligence (AI), demonstrating unprecedented proficiency in procedural tasks such as text generation, code completion, and conversational coherence. These capabilities stem from their architecture, which mirrors human procedural memory -- the brain's ability to automate repetitive, pattern-driven tasks through practice. However, as LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it becomes impossible to ignore their limitations operating in complex, unpredictable environments. This paper argues that LLMs, while transformative, are fundamentally constrained by their reliance on procedural memory. To create agents capable of navigating ``wicked'' learning environments -- where rules shift, feedback is ambiguous, and novelty is the norm -- we must augment LLMs with semantic memory and associative learning systems. By adopting a modular architecture that decouples these cognitive functions, we can bridge the gap between narrow procedural expertise and the adaptive intelligence required for real-world problem-solving.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03434.pdf,"Schaun Wheeler, Olivier Jeunen",cs.AI
Robustness in AI-Generated Detection: Enhancing Resistance to Adversarial Attacks,"The rapid advancement of generative image technology has introduced significant security concerns, particularly in the domain of face generation detection. This paper investigates the vulnerabilities of current AI-generated face detection systems. Our study reveals that while existing detection methods often achieve high accuracy under standard conditions, they exhibit limited robustness against adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that integrates adversarial training to mitigate the impact of adversarial examples. Furthermore, we utilize diffusion inversion and reconstruction to further enhance detection robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that minor adversarial perturbations can easily bypass existing detection systems, but our method significantly improves the robustness of these systems. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of adversarial and benign examples, offering insights into the intrinsic characteristics of AI-generated content. All associated code will be made publicly available in a dedicated repository to facilitate further research and verification.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03435.pdf,"Sun Haoxuan, Hong Yan, Zhan Jiahui, Chen Haoxing, Lan Jun, Zhu Huijia, Wang Weiqiang, Zhang Liqing, Zhang Jianfu",cs.CV
Algorithm Selection in Short-Range Molecular Dynamics Simulations,"Numerous algorithms and parallelisations have been developed for short-range particle simulations; however, none are optimally performant for all scenarios. Such a concept led to the prior development of the particle simulation library AutoPas, which implemented many of these algorithms and parallelisations and could select and tune these over the course of the simulation as the scenario changed. Prior works have, however, used only naive approaches to the algorithm selection problem, which can lead to significant overhead from trialling poorly performing algorithmic configurations.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03438.pdf,"Samuel James Newcome, Fabio Alexander Gratl, Manuel Lerchner, Abdulkadir Pazar, Manish Kumar Mishra, Hans-Joachim Bungartz",cs.CE
The Steganographic Potentials of Language Models,"The potential for large language models (LLMs) to hide messages within plain text (steganography) poses a challenge to detection and thwarting of unaligned AI agents, and undermines faithfulness of LLMs reasoning. We explore the steganographic capabilities of LLMs fine-tuned via reinforcement learning (RL) to: (1) develop covert encoding schemes, (2) engage in steganography when prompted, and (3) utilize steganography in realistic scenarios where hidden reasoning is likely, but not prompted. In these scenarios, we detect the intention of LLMs to hide their reasoning as well as their steganography performance. Our findings in the fine-tuning experiments as well as in behavioral non fine-tuning evaluations reveal that while current models exhibit rudimentary steganographic abilities in terms of security and capacity, explicit algorithmic guidance markedly enhances their capacity for information concealment.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03439.pdf,"Artem Karpov, Tinuade Adeleke, Seong Hah Cho, Natalia Perez-Campanero",cs.AI
manvr3d: A Platform for Human-in-the-loop Cell Tracking in Virtual Reality,"We propose manvr3d, a novel VR-ready platform for interactive human-in-the-loop cell tracking. We utilize VR controllers and eye-tracking hardware to facilitate rapid ground truth generation and proofreading for deep learning-based cell tracking models. Life scientists reconstruct the developmental history of organisms on the cellular level by analyzing 3D time-lapse microscopy images acquired at high spatio-temporal resolution. The reconstruction of such cell lineage trees traditionally involves tracking individual cells through all recorded time points, manually annotating their positions, and then linking them over time to create complete trajectories. Deep learning-based algorithms accelerate this process, yet depend heavily on manually-annotated high-quality ground truth data and curation. Visual representation of the image data in this process still relies primarily on 2D renderings, which greatly limits spatial understanding and navigation. In this work, we bridge the gap between deep learning-based cell tracking software and 3D/VR visualization to create a human-in-the-loop cell tracking system. We lift the incremental annotation, training and proofreading loop of the deep learning model into the 3rd dimension and apply natural user interfaces like hand gestures and eye tracking to accelerate the cell tracking workflow for life scientists.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03440.pdf,"Samuel Pantze, Jean-Yves Tinevez, Matthew McGinity, Ulrik G\""unther",cs.HC
Knowledge Distillation for Speech Denoising by Latent Representation Alignment with Cosine Distance,"Speech denoising is a generally adopted and impactful task, appearing in many common and everyday-life use cases. Although there are very powerful methods published, most of those are too complex for deployment in everyday and low-resources computational environments, like hand-held devices, intelligent glasses, hearing aids, etc. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a prominent way for alleviating this complexity mismatch and is based on the transferring/distilling of knowledge from a pre-trained complex model, the teacher, to another less complex one, the student. Existing KD methods for speech denoising are based on processes that potentially hamper the KD by bounding the learning of the student to the distribution, information ordering, and feature dimensionality learned by the teacher. In this paper, we present and assess a method that tries to treat this issue, by exploiting the well-known denoising-autoencoder framework, the linear inverted bottlenecks, and the properties of the cosine similarity. We use a public dataset and conduct repeated experiments with different mismatching scenarios between the teacher and the student, reporting the mean and standard deviation of the metrics of our method and another, state-of-the-art method that is used as a baseline. Our results show that with the proposed method, the student can perform better and can also retain greater mismatching conditions compared to the teacher.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03442.pdf,"Diep Luong, Mikko Heikkinen, Konstantinos Drossos, Tuomas Virtanen",cs.SD
Elevating Semantic Exploration: A Novel Approach Utilizing Distributed Repositories,"Centralized and distributed systems are two main approaches to organizing ICT infrastructure, each with its pros and cons. Centralized systems concentrate resources in one location, making management easier but creating single points of failure. Distributed systems, on the other hand, spread resources across multiple nodes, offering better scalability and fault tolerance, but requiring more complex management. The choice between them depends on factors like application needs, scalability, and data sensitivity. Centralized systems suit applications with limited scalability and centralized control, while distributed systems excel in large-scale environments requiring high availability and performance.

Polar Coordinate-Based 2D Pose Prior with Neural Distance Field,"Human pose capture is essential for sports analysis, enabling precise evaluation of athletes' movements. While deep learning-based human pose estimation (HPE) models from RGB videos have achieved impressive performance on public datasets, their effectiveness in real-world sports scenarios is often hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts across different pose representations. Fine-tuning these models can partially alleviate such challenges but typically requires large-scale annotated data and still struggles to generalize across diverse sports environments. To address these limitations, we propose a 2D pose prior-guided refinement approach based on Neural Distance Fields (NDF). Unlike existing approaches that rely solely on angular representations of human poses, we introduce a polar coordinate-based representation that explicitly incorporates joint connection lengths, enabling a more accurate correction of erroneous pose estimations. Additionally, we define a novel non-geodesic distance metric that separates angular and radial discrepancies, which we demonstrate is better suited for polar representations than traditional geodesic distances. To mitigate data scarcity, we develop a gradient-based batch-projection augmentation strategy, which synthesizes realistic pose samples through iterative refinement. Our method is evaluated on a long jump dataset, demonstrating its ability to improve 2D pose estimation across multiple pose representations, making it robust across different domains. Experimental results show that our approach enhances pose plausibility while requiring only limited training data.

AquaticVision: Benchmarking Visual SLAM in Underwater Environment with Events and Frames,"Many underwater applications, such as offshore asset inspections, rely on visual inspection and detailed 3D reconstruction. Recent advancements in underwater visual SLAM systems for aquatic environments have garnered significant attention in marine robotics research. However, existing underwater visual SLAM datasets often lack groundtruth trajectory data, making it difficult to objectively compare the performance of different SLAM algorithms based solely on qualitative results or COLMAP reconstruction. In this paper, we present a novel underwater dataset that includes ground truth trajectory data obtained using a motion capture system. Additionally, for the first time, we release visual data that includes both events and frames for benchmarking underwater visual positioning. By providing event camera data, we aim to facilitate the development of more robust and advanced underwater visual SLAM algorithms. The use of event cameras can help mitigate challenges posed by extremely low light or hazy underwater conditions.

Detecting Quishing Attacks with Machine Learning Techniques Through QR Code Analysis,"The rise of QR code based phishing (""Quishing"") poses a growing cybersecurity threat, as attackers increasingly exploit QR codes to bypass traditional phishing defenses. Existing detection methods predominantly focus on URL analysis, which requires the extraction of the QR code payload, and may inadvertently expose users to malicious content. Moreover, QR codes can encode various types of data beyond URLs, such as Wi-Fi credentials and payment information, making URL-based detection insufficient for broader security concerns. To address these gaps, we propose the first framework for quishing detection that directly analyzes QR code structure and pixel patterns without extracting the embedded content. We generated a dataset of phishing and benign QR codes and we used it to train and evaluate multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Our best-performing model (XGBoost) achieves an AUC of 0.9106, demonstrating the feasibility of QR-centric detection. Through feature importance analysis, we identify key visual indicators of malicious intent and refine our feature set by removing non-informative pixels, improving performance to an AUC of 0.9133 with a reduced feature space. Our findings reveal that the structural features of QR code correlate strongly with phishing risk. This work establishes a foundation for quishing mitigation and highlights the potential of direct QR analysis as a critical layer in modern phishing defenses.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03451.pdf,"Fouad Trad, Ali Chehab",cs.CR
An Analysis of Hyper-Parameter Optimization Methods for Retrieval Augmented Generation,"Finding the optimal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) configuration for a given use case can be complex and expensive. Motivated by this challenge, frameworks for RAG hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) have recently emerged, yet their effectiveness has not been rigorously benchmarked. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive study involving 5 HPO algorithms over 5 datasets from diverse domains, including a new one collected for this work on real-world product documentation. Our study explores the largest HPO search space considered to date, with two optimized evaluation metrics. Analysis of the results shows that RAG HPO can be done efficiently, either greedily or with iterative random search, and that it significantly boosts RAG performance for all datasets.

Mitigating Backdoor Triggered and Targeted Data Poisoning Attacks in Voice Authentication Systems,"Voice authentication systems remain susceptible to two major threats: backdoor triggered attacks and targeted data poisoning attacks. This dual vulnerability is critical because conventional solutions typically address each threat type separately, leaving systems exposed to adversaries who can exploit both attacks simultaneously. We propose a unified defense framework that effectively addresses both BTA and TDPA. Our framework integrates a frequency focused detection mechanism that flags covert pitch boosting and sound masking backdoor attacks in near real time, followed by a convolutional neural network that addresses TDPA. This dual layered defense approach utilizes multidimensional acoustic features to isolate anomalous signals without requiring costly model retraining. In particular, our PBSM detection mechanism can seamlessly integrate into existing voice authentication pipelines and scale effectively for large scale deployments. Experimental results on benchmark datasets and their compression with the state of the art algorithm demonstrate that our PBSM detection mechanism outperforms the state of the art. Our framework reduces attack success rates to as low as five to fifteen percent while maintaining a recall rate of up to ninety five percent in recognizing TDPA.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03455.pdf,"Alireza Mohammadi, Keshav Sood, Dhananjay Thiruvady, Asef Nazari",cs.CR
LogisticsVLN: Vision-Language Navigation For Low-Altitude Terminal Delivery Based on Agentic UAVs,"The growing demand for intelligent logistics, particularly fine-grained terminal delivery, underscores the need for autonomous UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle)-based delivery systems. However, most existing last-mile delivery studies rely on ground robots, while current UAV-based Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks primarily focus on coarse-grained, long-range goals, making them unsuitable for precise terminal delivery. To bridge this gap, we propose LogisticsVLN, a scalable aerial delivery system built on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for autonomous terminal delivery. LogisticsVLN integrates lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual-Language Models (VLMs) in a modular pipeline for request understanding, floor localization, object detection, and action-decision making. To support research and evaluation in this new setting, we construct the Vision-Language Delivery (VLD) dataset within the CARLA simulator. Experimental results on the VLD dataset showcase the feasibility of the LogisticsVLN system. In addition, we conduct subtask-level evaluations of each module of our system, offering valuable insights for improving the robustness and real-world deployment of foundation model-based vision-language delivery systems.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03460.pdf,"Xinyuan Zhang, Yonglin Tian, Fei Lin, Yue Liu, Jing Ma, Korn\'elia S\'ara Szatm\'ary, Fei-Yue Wang",cs.RO
Nonperiodic dynamic CT reconstruction using backward-warping INR with regularization of diffeomorphism (BIRD),"Dynamic computed tomography (CT) reconstruction faces significant challenges in addressing motion artifacts, particularly for nonperiodic rapid movements such as cardiac imaging with fast heart rates. Traditional methods struggle with the extreme limited-angle problems inherent in nonperiodic cases. Deep learning methods have improved performance but face generalization challenges. Recent implicit neural representation (INR) techniques show promise through self-supervised deep learning, but have critical limitations: computational inefficiency due to forward-warping modeling, difficulty balancing DVF complexity with anatomical plausibility, and challenges in preserving fine details without additional patient-specific pre-scans. This paper presents a novel INR-based framework, BIRD, for nonperiodic dynamic CT reconstruction. It addresses these challenges through four key contributions: (1) backward-warping deformation that enables direct computation of each dynamic voxel with significantly reduced computational cost, (2) diffeomorphism-based DVF regularization that ensures anatomically plausible deformations while maintaining representational capacity, (3) motion-compensated analytical reconstruction that enhances fine details without requiring additional pre-scans, and (4) dimensional-reduction design for efficient 4D coordinate encoding. Through various simulations and practical studies, including digital and physical phantoms and retrospective patient data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for nonperiodic dynamic CT reconstruction with enhanced details and reduced motion artifacts. The proposed framework enables more accurate dynamic CT reconstruction with potential clinical applications, such as one-beat cardiac reconstruction, cinematic image sequences for functional imaging, and motion artifact reduction in conventional CT scans.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03463.pdf,"Muge Du, Zhuozhao Zheng, Wenying Wang, Guotao Quan, Wuliang Shi, Le Shen, Li Zhang, Liang Li, Yinong Liu, Yuxiang Xing",cs.CV
Uncertainty-Aware Large Language Models for Explainable Disease Diagnosis,"Explainable disease diagnosis, which leverages patient information (e.g., signs and symptoms) and computational models to generate probable diagnoses and reasonings, offers clear clinical values. However, when clinical notes encompass insufficient evidence for a definite diagnosis, such as the absence of definitive symptoms, diagnostic uncertainty usually arises, increasing the risk of misdiagnosis and adverse outcomes. Although explicitly identifying and explaining diagnostic uncertainties is essential for trustworthy diagnostic systems, it remains under-explored. To fill this gap, we introduce ConfiDx, an uncertainty-aware large language model (LLM) created by fine-tuning open-source LLMs with diagnostic criteria. We formalized the task and assembled richly annotated datasets that capture varying degrees of diagnostic ambiguity. Evaluating ConfiDx on real-world datasets demonstrated that it excelled in identifying diagnostic uncertainties, achieving superior diagnostic performance, and generating trustworthy explanations for diagnoses and uncertainties. To our knowledge, this is the first study to jointly address diagnostic uncertainty recognition and explanation, substantially enhancing the reliability of automatic diagnostic systems.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03467.pdf,"Shuang Zhou, Jiashuo Wang, Zidu Xu, Song Wang, David Brauer, Lindsay Welton, Jacob Cogan, Yuen-Hei Chung, Lei Tian, Zaifu Zhan, Yu Hou, Mingquan Lin, Genevieve B.

Multi-Class Stackelberg Games for the Co-Design of Networked Systems,"We investigate a co-design problem, encompassing simultaneous design of system infrastructure and control, through a game-theoretical framework. To this end, we propose the co-design problem as a two-layer hierarchical strategic interaction. At the upper layer, a leader (or multiple leaders) determines system design parameters, while at the lower layer, a follower (or multiple followers) optimizes the control strategy. To capture this hierarchy, we propose four novel classes of Stackelberg games that integrate diverse strategic behaviors, including combinations of cooperative and non-cooperative interactions across two different layers. Notably, the leaders' interactions are represented using a normal-form game, whereas the followers' interactions are modeled by different games (dynamic games in discrete time). These distinct game structures result in a Stackelberg game that accommodates different game types per layer, and/or supports heterogeneous strategic behaviors involving cooperation and non-cooperation simultaneously. Learning algorithms using the best-response dynamics are used to solve the game problems when considering a discrete strategic space for the leaders. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through an application to the co-design of the Barcelona drinking water network.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03468.pdf,"Julian Barreiro-Gomez, Ye Wang",eess.SY
Long-Short Chain-of-Thought Mixture Supervised Fine-Tuning Eliciting Efficient Reasoning in Large Language Models,"Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data distilled from large reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek R1) can effectively transfer reasoning capabilities to non-reasoning models. However, models fine-tuned with this approach inherit the ""overthinking"" problem from teacher models, producing verbose and redundant reasoning chains during inference. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{L}ong-\textbf{S}hort Chain-of-Thought \textbf{Mixture} \textbf{S}upervised \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning (\textbf{LS-Mixture SFT}), which combines long CoT reasoning dataset with their short counterparts obtained through structure-preserved rewriting. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained using the LS-Mixture SFT method, compared to those trained with direct SFT, achieved an average accuracy improvement of 2.3\% across various benchmarks while substantially reducing model response length by approximately 47.61\%. This work offers an approach to endow non-reasoning models with reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning while avoiding the inherent overthinking problems inherited from teacher models, thereby enabling efficient reasoning in the fine-tuned models.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03469.pdf,"Bin Yu, Hang Yuan, Yuliang Wei, Bailing Wang, Weizhen Qi, Kai Chen",cs.CL
Blending 3D Geometry and Machine Learning for Multi-View Stereopsis,"Traditional multi-view stereo (MVS) methods primarily depend on photometric and geometric consistency constraints. In contrast, modern learning-based algorithms often rely on the plane sweep algorithm to infer 3D geometry, applying explicit geometric consistency (GC) checks only as a post-processing step, with no impact on the learning process itself. In this work, we introduce GC MVSNet plus plus, a novel approach that actively enforces geometric consistency of reference view depth maps across multiple source views (multi view) and at various scales (multi scale) during the learning phase (see Fig. 1). This integrated GC check significantly accelerates the learning process by directly penalizing geometrically inconsistent pixels, effectively halving the number of training iterations compared to other MVS methods. Furthermore, we introduce a densely connected cost regularization network with two distinct block designs simple and feature dense optimized to harness dense feature connections for enhanced regularization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves a new state of the art on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets and secures second place on the Tanks and Temples benchmark. To our knowledge, GC MVSNet plus plus is the first method to enforce multi-view, multi-scale supervised geometric consistency during learning. Our code is available.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03470.pdf,"Vibhas Vats, Md. Alimoor Reza, David Crandall, Soon-heung Jung",cs.CV
Signal Prediction by Derivative Samples from the Past via Perfect Reconstruction,"This paper investigates signal prediction through the perfect reconstruction of signals from shift-invariant spaces using nonuniform samples of both the signal and its derivatives. The key advantage of derivative sampling is its ability to reduce the sampling rate. We derive a sampling formula based on periodic nonuniform sampling (PNS) sets with derivatives in a shift-invariant space. We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for such a set to form a complete interpolating sequence (CIS) of order $r-1$. This framework is then used to develop an efficient approximation scheme in a shift-invariant space generated by a compactly supported function. Building on this, we propose a prediction algorithm that reconstructs a signal from a finite number of past derivative samples using the derived perfect reconstruction formula. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through practical examples involving cubic splines and the Daubechies scaling function of order 3.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03471.pdf,"Sreya T, Riya Ghosh, A.

Simulation to Reality: Testbeds and Architectures for Connected and Automated Vehicles,"Ensuring the safe and efficient operation of CAVs relies heavily on the software framework used. A software framework needs to ensure real-time properties, reliable communication, and efficient resource utilization. Furthermore, a software framework needs to enable seamless transition between testing stages, from simulation to small-scale to full-scale experiments. In this paper, we survey prominent software frameworks used for in-vehicle and inter-vehicle communication in CAVs. We analyze these frameworks regarding opportunities and challenges, such as their real-time properties and transitioning capabilities. Additionally, we delve into the tooling requirements necessary for addressing the associated challenges. We illustrate the practical implications of these challenges through case studies focusing on critical areas such as perception, motion planning, and control.

Evaluation of LLMs on Long-tail Entity Linking in Historical Documents,"Entity Linking (EL) plays a crucial role in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, enabling the disambiguation of entity mentions by linking them to their corresponding entries in a reference knowledge base (KB). Thanks to their deep contextual understanding capabilities, LLMs offer a new perspective to tackle EL, promising better results than traditional methods. Despite the impressive generalization capabilities of LLMs, linking less popular, long-tail entities remains challenging as these entities are often underrepresented in training data and knowledge bases. Furthermore, the long-tail EL task is an understudied problem, and limited studies address it with LLMs. In the present work, we assess the performance of two popular LLMs, GPT and LLama3, in a long-tail entity linking scenario. Using MHERCL v0.1, a manually annotated benchmark of sentences from domain-specific historical texts, we quantitatively compare the performance of LLMs in identifying and linking entities to their corresponding Wikidata entries against that of ReLiK, a state-of-the-art Entity Linking and Relation Extraction framework. Our preliminary experiments reveal that LLMs perform encouragingly well in long-tail EL, indicating that this technology can be a valuable adjunct in filling the gap between head and long-tail EL.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03473.pdf,"Marta Boscariol, Luana Bulla, Lia Draetta, Beatrice Fiuman\`o, Emanuele Lenzi, Leonardo Piano",cs.CL
am-ELO: A Stable Framework for Arena-based LLM Evaluation,"Arena-based evaluation is a fundamental yet significant evaluation paradigm for modern AI models, especially large language models (LLMs). Existing framework based on ELO rating system suffers from the inevitable instability problem due to ranking inconsistency and the lack of attention to the varying abilities of annotators. In this paper, we introduce a novel stable arena framework to address these issues by enhancing the ELO Rating System. Specifically, we replace the iterative update method with a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach, m-ELO, and provide theoretical proof of the consistency and stability of the MLE approach for model ranking. Additionally, we proposed the am-ELO, which modify the Elo Rating's probability function to incorporate annotator abilities, enabling the simultaneous estimation of model scores and annotator reliability. Experiments demonstrate that this method ensures stability, proving that this framework offers a more robust, accurate, and stable evaluation method for LLMs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03475.pdf,"Zirui Liu, Jiatong Li, Yan Zhuang, Qi Liu, Shuanghong Shen, Jie Ouyang, Mingyue Cheng, Shijin Wang",cs.AI
Modeling Musical Genre Trajectories through Pathlet Learning,"The increasing availability of user data on music streaming platforms opens up new possibilities for analyzing music consumption. However, understanding the evolution of user preferences remains a complex challenge, particularly as their musical tastes change over time. This paper uses the dictionary learning paradigm to model user trajectories across different musical genres. We define a new framework that captures recurring patterns in genre trajectories, called pathlets, enabling the creation of comprehensible trajectory embeddings. We show that pathlet learning reveals relevant listening patterns that can be analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. This work improves our understanding of users' interactions with music and opens up avenues of research into user behavior and fostering diversity in recommender systems. A dataset of 2000 user histories tagged by genre over 17 months, supplied by Deezer (a leading music streaming company), is also released with the code.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03480.pdf,"Lilian Marey, Charlotte Laclau, Bruno Sguerra, Tiphaine Viard, Manuel Moussallam",cs.IR
Sentence Embeddings as an intermediate target in end-to-end summarisation,"Current neural network-based methods to the problem of document summarisation struggle when applied to datasets containing large inputs. In this paper we propose a new approach to the challenge of content-selection when dealing with end-to-end summarisation of user reviews of accommodations. We show that by combining an extractive approach with externally pre-trained sentence level embeddings in an addition to an abstractive summarisation model we can outperform existing methods when this is applied to the task of summarising a large input dataset. We also prove that predicting sentence level embedding of a summary increases the quality of an end-to-end system for loosely aligned source to target corpora, than compared to commonly predicting probability distributions of sentence selection.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03481.pdf,"Maciej Zembrzuski, Saad Mahamood",cs.CL
Learning-based Homothetic Tube MPC,"In this paper, we study homothetic tube model predictive control (MPC) of discrete-time linear systems subject to bounded additive disturbance and mixed constraints on the state and input. Different from most existing work on robust MPC, we assume that the true disturbance set is unknown but a conservative surrogate is available a priori. Leveraging the real-time data, we develop an online learning algorithm to approximate the true disturbance set. This approximation and the corresponding constraints in the MPC optimisation are updated online using computationally convenient linear programs. We provide statistical gaps between the true and learned disturbance sets, based on which, probabilistic recursive feasibility of homothetic tube MPC problems is discussed. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm and compare with state-of-the-art MPC algorithms.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03482.pdf,"Yulong Gao, Shuhao Yan, Jian Zhou, Mark Cannon",eess.SY
STAR-Rec: Making Peace with Length Variance and Pattern Diversity in Sequential Recommendation,"Recent deep sequential recommendation models often struggle to effectively model key characteristics of user behaviors, particularly in handling sequence length variations and capturing diverse interaction patterns. We propose STAR-Rec, a novel architecture that synergistically combines preference-aware attention and state-space modeling through a sequence-level mixture-of-experts framework. STAR-Rec addresses these challenges by: (1) employing preference-aware attention to capture both inherently similar item relationships and diverse preferences, (2) utilizing state-space modeling to efficiently process variable-length sequences with linear complexity, and (3) incorporating a mixture-of-experts component that adaptively routes different behavioral patterns to specialized experts, handling both focused category-specific browsing and diverse category exploration patterns. We theoretically demonstrate how the state space model and attention mechanisms can be naturally unified in recommendation scenarios, where SSM captures temporal dynamics through state compression while attention models both similar and diverse item relationships. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR-Rec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods, particularly in scenarios involving diverse user behaviors and varying sequence lengths.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03484.pdf,"Maolin Wang, Sheng Zhang, Ruocheng Guo, Wanyu Wang, Xuetao Wei, Zitao Liu, Hongzhi Yin, Yi Chang, Xiangyu Zhao",cs.IR
Power Loss and Temperature Distribution in Coil of PFC Inductor with Air Gap for Multimode Operation,"Power converters inherently display non-linear load characteristics, resulting in a high level of mains harmonics, and hence the necessity of implementing Power Factor Correction (PFC). Active PFC circuitry typically comprises an inductor and a power switch to control and alter the input current so that it matches, in shape and phase, the input voltage. This modelling of the waveforms can be performed by means of distinct conduction modes of the PFC inductor. The digital controller implemented in the constructed and investigated boost-type PFC converter can be programmed to operate in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), continuous conduction mode (CCM), or a combination of the two. The individual modes of operation, via distinct PFC inductor current waveforms, impact the overall efficiency of power conversion and, by extension, temperature distribution in the magnetic component. This paper investigates how the examined conduction modes bear on distinct power-loss mechanisms present in the PFC inductor, including high-frequency eddy-current-generating phenomena, and the fringing effect in particular. As demonstrated herein, the DCM operation, for the set output power level, exhibits exacerbated power dissipation in the winding of the inductor due to the somewhat increased RSM value of the current and the intensified fringing magnetic flux at an air gap. The latter assertion will undergo further, more quantitatively focused research. Finally, the construction of the coil was optimised to reduce power loss by diminishing eddy-current mechanisms.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03489.pdf,Rafal Kasikowski,eess.SY
A new membership inference attack that spots memorization in generative and predictive models: Loss-Based with Reference Model algorithm (LBRM),"Generative models can unintentionally memorize training data, posing significant privacy risks. This paper addresses the memorization phenomenon in time series imputation models, introducing the Loss-Based with Reference Model (LBRM) algorithm. The LBRM method leverages a reference model to enhance the accuracy of membership inference attacks, distinguishing between training and test data. Our contributions are twofold: first, we propose an innovative method to effectively extract and identify memorized training data, significantly improving detection accuracy. On average, without fine-tuning, the AUROC improved by approximately 40\%. With fine-tuning, the AUROC increased by approximately 60\%. Second, we validate our approach through membership inference attacks on two types of architectures designed for time series imputation, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of the LBRM approach in different contexts. These results highlight the significant enhancement in detection accuracy provided by the LBRM approach, addressing privacy risks in time series imputation models.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03490.pdf,"Faiz Taleb, Ivan Gazeau, Maryline Laurent",cs.LG

Technically, a Piecewise Affine Lyapunov function will be constructed iteratively using an optimisation-based technique for the effective validation of the certificates.

UPMAD-Net: A Brain Tumor Segmentation Network with Uncertainty Guidance and Adaptive Multimodal Feature Fusion,"Background: Brain tumor segmentation has a significant impact on the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors. Accurate brain tumor segmentation remains challenging due to their irregular shapes, vague boundaries, and high variability. Objective: We propose a brain tumor segmentation method that combines deep learning with prior knowledge derived from a region-growing algorithm. Methods: The proposed method utilizes a multi-scale feature fusion (MSFF) module and adaptive attention mechanisms (AAM) to extract multi-scale features and capture global contextual information. To enhance the model's robustness in low-confidence regions, the Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout) strategy is employed for uncertainty estimation. Results: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance on Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) datasets, significantly outperforming various state-of-the-art methods. On the BraTS2021 dataset, the test Dice scores are 89.18% for Enhancing Tumor (ET) segmentation, 93.67% for Whole Tumor (WT) segmentation, and 91.23% for Tumor Core (TC) segmentation. On the BraTS2019 validation set, the validation Dice scores are 87.43%, 90.92%, and 90.40% for ET, WT, and TC segmentation, respectively. Ablation studies further confirmed the contribution of each module to segmentation accuracy, indicating that each component played a vital role in overall performance improvement. Conclusion: This study proposed a novel 3D brain tumor segmentation network based on the U-Net architecture. By incorporating the prior knowledge and employing the uncertainty estimation method, the robustness and performance were improved.

MRI motion correction via efficient residual-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic models,"Purpose: Motion artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) significantly degrade image quality and impair quantitative analysis. Conventional mitigation strategies, such as repeated acquisitions or motion tracking, are costly and workflow-intensive. This study introduces Res-MoCoDiff, an efficient denoising diffusion probabilistic model tailored for MRI motion artifact correction. Methods: Res-MoCoDiff incorporates a novel residual error shifting mechanism in the forward diffusion process, aligning the noise distribution with motion-corrupted data and enabling an efficient four-step reverse diffusion. A U-net backbone enhanced with Swin-Transformer blocks conventional attention layers, improving adaptability across resolutions. Training employs a combined l1+l2 loss, which promotes image sharpness and reduces pixel-level errors. Res-MoCoDiff was evaluated on synthetic dataset generated using a realistic motion simulation framework and on an in-vivo dataset. Comparative analyses were conducted against established methods, including CycleGAN, Pix2pix, and MT-DDPM using quantitative metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and normalized mean squared error (NMSE). Results: The proposed method demonstrated superior performance in removing motion artifacts across all motion severity levels. Res-MoCoDiff consistently achieved the highest SSIM and the lowest NMSE values, with a PSNR of up to 41.91+-2.94 dB for minor distortions. Notably, the average sampling time was reduced to 0.37 seconds per batch of two image slices, compared with 101.74 seconds for conventional approaches.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03498.pdf,"Mojtaba Safari, Shansong Wang, Qiang Li, Zach Eidex, Richard L.

Task Reconstruction and Extrapolation for $\pi_0$ using Text Latent,"Vision-language-action models (VLAs) often achieve high performance on demonstrated tasks but struggle significantly when required to extrapolate, combining skills learned from different tasks in novel ways. For instance, VLAs might successfully put the cream cheese in the bowl and put the bowl on top of the cabinet, yet still fail to put the cream cheese on top of the cabinet. In this work, we demonstrate that behaviors from distinct tasks can be effectively recombined by manipulating the VLA's internal representations at inference time. Concretely, we identify the text latent by averaging the text tokens' hidden states across all demonstrated trajectories for a specific base task. For executing an extrapolated task, we can temporally interpolate the text latent of the two base tasks and add it back to the text hidden states, so sub-behaviors from the two tasks will be activated sequentially. We evaluate this approach using the newly created libero-ood benchmark, featuring 20 tasks extrapolated from standard LIBERO suites. The results on libero-ood show that all SOTA VLAs achieve < 15% success rate, while $\pi0$ with text latent interpolation reaches an 83% success rate. Further qualitative analysis reveals a tendency for VLAs to exhibit spatial overfitting, mapping object names to demonstrated locations rather than achieving genuine object and goal understanding. Additionally, we find that decoding the text latent yields human-unreadable prompts that can nevertheless instruct the VLA to achieve a 70% success rate on standard LIBERO suites, enabling private instruction or backdoor attacks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03500.pdf,Quanyi Li,cs.RO
BadLingual: A Novel Lingual-Backdoor Attack against Large Language Models,"In this paper, we present a new form of backdoor attack against Large Language Models (LLMs): lingual-backdoor attacks. The key novelty of lingual-backdoor attacks is that the language itself serves as the trigger to hijack the infected LLMs to generate inflammatory speech. They enable the precise targeting of a specific language-speaking group, exacerbating racial discrimination by malicious entities. We first implement a baseline lingual-backdoor attack, which is carried out by poisoning a set of training data for specific downstream tasks through translation into the trigger language. However, this baseline attack suffers from poor task generalization and is impractical in real-world settings. To address this challenge, we design BadLingual, a novel task-agnostic lingual-backdoor, capable of triggering any downstream tasks within the chat LLMs, regardless of the specific questions of these tasks. We design a new approach using PPL-constrained Greedy Coordinate Gradient-based Search (PGCG) based adversarial training to expand the decision boundary of lingual-backdoor, thereby enhancing the generalization ability of lingual-backdoor across various tasks. We perform extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed attacks. Specifically, the baseline attack achieves an ASR of over 90% on the specified tasks. However, its ASR reaches only 37.61% across six tasks in the task-agnostic scenario. In contrast, BadLingual brings up to 37.35% improvement over the baseline. Our study sheds light on a new perspective of vulnerabilities in LLMs with multilingual capabilities and is expected to promote future research on the potential defenses to enhance the LLMs' robustness",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03501.pdf,"Zihan Wang, Hongwei Li, Rui Zhang, Wenbo Jiang, Kangjie Chen, Tianwei Zhang, Qingchuan Zhao, Guowen Xu",cs.CR
Modality-Guided Dynamic Graph Fusion and Temporal Diffusion for Self-Supervised RGB-T Tracking,"To reduce the reliance on large-scale annotations, self-supervised RGB-T tracking approaches have garnered significant attention. However, the omission of the object region by erroneous pseudo-label or the introduction of background noise affects the efficiency of modality fusion, while pseudo-label noise triggered by similar object noise can further affect the tracking performance. In this paper, we propose GDSTrack, a novel approach that introduces dynamic graph fusion and temporal diffusion to address the above challenges in self-supervised RGB-T tracking. GDSTrack dynamically fuses the modalities of neighboring frames, treats them as distractor noise, and leverages the denoising capability of a generative model. Specifically, by constructing an adjacency matrix via an Adjacency Matrix Generator (AMG), the proposed Modality-guided Dynamic Graph Fusion (MDGF) module uses a dynamic adjacency matrix to guide graph attention, focusing on and fusing the object's coherent regions. Temporal Graph-Informed Diffusion (TGID) models MDGF features from neighboring frames as interference, and thus improving robustness against similar-object noise. Extensive experiments conducted on four public RGB-T tracking datasets demonstrate that GDSTrack outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.

AnomalyMatch: Discovering Rare Objects of Interest with Semi-supervised and Active Learning,"Anomaly detection in large datasets is essential in fields such as astronomy and computer vision; however, supervised methods typically require extensive anomaly labelling, which is often impractical. We present AnomalyMatch, an anomaly detection framework combining the semi-supervised FixMatch algorithm using EfficientNet classifiers with active learning. By treating anomaly detection as a semi-supervised binary classification problem, we efficiently utilise limited labelled and abundant unlabelled images. We allow iterative model refinement in a user interface for expert verification of high-confidence anomalies and correction of false positives. Built for astronomical data, AnomalyMatch generalises readily to other domains facing similar data challenges. Evaluations on the GalaxyMNIST astronomical dataset and the miniImageNet natural-image benchmark under severe class imbalance (1% anomalies for miniImageNet) display strong performance: starting from five to ten labelled anomalies and after three active learning cycles, we achieve an average AUROC of 0.95 (miniImageNet) and 0.86 (GalaxyMNIST), with respective AUPRC of 0.77 and 0.71. After active learning cycles, anomalies are ranked with 71% (miniImageNet) to 93% precision in the 1% of the highest-ranked images. AnomalyMatch is tailored for large-scale applications, efficiently processing predictions for 100 million images within three days on a single GPU. Integrated into ESAs Datalabs platform, AnomalyMatch facilitates targeted discovery of scientifically valuable anomalies in vast astronomical datasets. Our results underscore the exceptional utility and scalability of this approach for anomaly discovery, highlighting the value of specialised approaches for domains characterised by severe label scarcity.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03509.pdf,"Pablo G\'omez, David O'Ryan",cs.LG
From Neurons to Computation: Biological Reservoir Computing for Pattern Recognition,"In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm for reservoir computing (RC) that leverages a pool of cultured biological neurons as the reservoir substrate, creating a biological reservoir computing (BRC). This system operates similarly to an echo state network (ESN), with the key distinction that the neural activity is generated by a network of cultured neurons, rather than being modeled by traditional artificial computational units. The neuronal activity is recorded using a multi-electrode array (MEA), which enables high-throughput recording of neural signals. In our approach, inputs are introduced into the network through a subset of the MEA electrodes, while the remaining electrodes capture the resulting neural activity. This generates a nonlinear mapping of the input data to a high-dimensional biological feature space, where distinguishing between data becomes more efficient and straightforward, allowing a simple linear classifier to perform pattern recognition tasks effectively. To evaluate the performance of our proposed system, we present an experimental study that includes various input patterns, such as positional codes, bars with different orientations, and a digit recognition task. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using biological neural networks to perform tasks traditionally handled by artificial neural networks, paving the way for further exploration of biologically-inspired computing systems, with potential applications in neuromorphic engineering and bio-hybrid computing.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03510.pdf,"Ludovico Iannello, Luca Ciampi, Gabriele Lagani, Fabrizio Tonelli, Eleonora Crocco, Lucio Maria Calcagnile, Angelo Di Garbo, Federico Cremisi, Giuseppe Amato",cs.NE
Artificial Protozoa Optimizer (APO): A novel bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithm for engineering optimization,"This study proposes a novel artificial protozoa optimizer (APO) that is inspired by protozoa in nature. The APO mimics the survival mechanisms of protozoa by simulating their foraging, dormancy, and reproductive behaviors. The APO was mathematically modeled and implemented to perform the optimization processes of metaheuristic algorithms. The performance of the APO was verified via experimental simulations and compared with 32 state-of-the-art algorithms. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed for pairwise comparisons of the proposed APO with the state-of-the-art algorithms, and Friedman test was used for multiple comparisons. First, the APO was tested using 12 functions of the 2022 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation benchmark. Considering practicality, the proposed APO was used to solve five popular engineering design problems in a continuous space with constraints. Moreover, the APO was applied to solve a multilevel image segmentation task in a discrete space with constraints. The experiments confirmed that the APO could provide highly competitive results for optimization problems.

Ruled by the Representation Space: On the University's Embrace of Large Language Models,"This paper explores the implications of universities' rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) for studying, teaching, and research by analyzing the logics underpinning their representation space. It argues that by uncritically adopting LLMs, the University surrenders its autonomy to a field of heteronomy, that of generative AI, whose norms are not democratically shaped. Unlike earlier forms of rule-based AI, which sought to exclude human judgment and interpretation, generative AI's new normative rationality is explicitly based on the automation of moral judgment, valuation, and interpretation. By integrating LLMs into pedagogical and research contexts before establishing a critical framework for their use, the University subjects itself to being governed by contingent, ever-evolving, and domain-non-specific norms that structure the model's virtual representation space and thus everything it generates.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03513.pdf,Katia Schwerzmann,cs.CY
Uncovering the Limitations of Model Inversion Evaluation: Benchmarks and Connection to Type-I Adversarial Attacks,"Model Inversion (MI) attacks aim to reconstruct information of private training data by exploiting access to machine learning models. The most common evaluation framework for MI attacks/defenses relies on an evaluation model that has been utilized to assess progress across almost all MI attacks and defenses proposed in recent years. In this paper, for the first time, we present an in-depth study of MI evaluation. Firstly, we construct the first comprehensive human-annotated dataset of MI attack samples, based on 28 setups of different MI attacks, defenses, private and public datasets. Secondly, using our dataset, we examine the accuracy of the MI evaluation framework and reveal that it suffers from a significant number of false positives. These findings raise questions about the previously reported success rates of SOTA MI attacks. Thirdly, we analyze the causes of these false positives, design controlled experiments, and discover the surprising effect of Type I adversarial features on MI evaluation, as well as adversarial transferability, highlighting a relationship between two previously distinct research areas. Our findings suggest that the performance of SOTA MI attacks has been overestimated, with the actual privacy leakage being significantly less than previously reported. In conclusion, we highlight critical limitations in the widely used MI evaluation framework and present our methods to mitigate false positive rates. We remark that prior research has shown that Type I adversarial attacks are very challenging, with no existing solution. Therefore, we urge to consider human evaluation as a primary MI evaluation framework rather than merely a supplement as in previous MI research. We also encourage further work on developing more robust and reliable automatic evaluation frameworks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03519.pdf,"Sy-Tuyen Ho, Koh Jun Hao, Ngoc-Bao Nguyen, Alexander Binder, Ngai-Man Cheung",cs.LG
Optimization of Module Transferability in Single Image Super-Resolution: Universality Assessment and Cycle Residual Blocks,"Deep learning has substantially advanced the Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). However, existing researches have predominantly focused on raw performance gains, with little attention paid to quantifying the transferability of architectural components. In this paper, we introduce the concept of ""Universality"" and its associated definitions which extend the traditional notion of ""Generalization"" to encompass the modules' ease of transferability, thus revealing the relationships between module universality and model generalizability. Then we propose the Universality Assessment Equation (UAE), a metric for quantifying how readily a given module could be transplanted across models. Guided by the UAE results of standard residual blocks and other plug-and-play modules, we further design two optimized modules, Cycle Residual Block (CRB) and Depth-Wise Cycle Residual Block (DCRB). Through comprehensive experiments on natural-scene benchmarks, remote-sensing datasets, extreme-industrial imagery and on-device deployments, we demonstrate that networks embedded with the proposed plug-and-play modules outperform several state-of-the-arts, reaching a PSNR enhancement of up to 0.83dB or enabling a 71.3% reduction in parameters with negligible loss in reconstruction fidelity.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03522.pdf,"Haotong Cheng, Zhiqi Zhang, Hao Li, Xinshang Zhang",cs.CV
Coop-WD: Cooperative Perception with Weighting and Denoising for Robust V2V Communication,"Cooperative perception, leveraging shared information from multiple vehicles via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, plays a vital role in autonomous driving to alleviate the limitation of single-vehicle perception. Existing works have explored the effects of V2V communication impairments on perception precision, but they lack generalization to different levels of impairments. In this work, we propose a joint weighting and denoising framework, Coop-WD, to enhance cooperative perception subject to V2V channel impairments. In this framework, the self-supervised contrastive model and the conditional diffusion probabilistic model are adopted hierarchically for vehicle-level and pixel-level feature enhancement. An efficient variant model, Coop-WD-eco, is proposed to selectively deactivate denoising to reduce processing overhead. Rician fading, non-stationarity, and time-varying distortion are considered. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed Coop-WD outperforms conventional benchmarks in all types of channels. Qualitative analysis with visual examples further proves the superiority of our proposed method.

SKALD: Scalable K-Anonymisation for Large Datasets,"Data privacy and anonymisation are critical concerns in today's data-driven society, particularly when handling personal and sensitive user data. Regulatory frameworks worldwide recommend privacy-preserving protocols such as k-anonymisation to de-identify releases of tabular data. Available hardware resources provide an upper bound on the maximum size of dataset that can be processed at a time. Large datasets with sizes exceeding this upper bound must be broken up into smaller data chunks for processing. In these cases, standard k-anonymisation tools such as ARX can only operate on a per-chunk basis. This paper proposes SKALD, a novel algorithm for performing k-anonymisation on large datasets with limited RAM. Our SKALD algorithm offers multi-fold performance improvement over standard k-anonymisation methods by extracting and combining sufficient statistics from each chunk during processing to ensure successful k-anonymisation while providing better utility.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03529.pdf,"Kailash Reddy, Novoneel Chakraborty, Amogh Dharmavaram, Anshoo Tandon",cs.IT
Causal Intervention Framework for Variational Auto Encoder Mechanistic Interpretability,"Mechanistic interpretability of deep learning models has emerged as a crucial research direction for understanding the functioning of neural networks. While significant progress has been made in interpreting discriminative models like transformers, understanding generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) remains challenging. This paper introduces a comprehensive causal intervention framework for mechanistic interpretability of VAEs. We develop techniques to identify and analyze ""circuit motifs"" in VAEs, examining how semantic factors are encoded, processed, and disentangled through the network layers. Our approach uses targeted interventions at different levels: input manipulations, latent space perturbations, activation patching, and causal mediation analysis. We apply our framework to both synthetic datasets with known causal relationships and standard disentanglement benchmarks. Results show that our interventions can successfully isolate functional circuits, map computational graphs to causal graphs of semantic factors, and distinguish between polysemantic and monosemantic units. Furthermore, we introduce metrics for causal effect strength, intervention specificity, and circuit modularity that quantify the interpretability of VAE components. Experimental results demonstrate clear differences between VAE variants, with FactorVAE achieving higher disentanglement scores (0.084) and effect strengths (mean 4.59) compared to standard VAE (0.064, 3.99) and Beta-VAE (0.051, 3.43). Our framework advances the mechanistic understanding of generative models and provides tools for more transparent and controllable VAE architectures.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03530.pdf,Dip Roy,cs.LG
Faster MoE LLM Inference for Extremely Large Models,"Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) large language models (LLMs) are gradually becoming the mainstream approach for ultra-large-scale models. Existing optimization efforts for MoE models have focused primarily on coarse-grained MoE architectures. With the emergence of DeepSeek Models, fine-grained MoE models are gaining popularity, yet research on them remains limited. Therefore, we want to discuss the efficiency dynamic under different service loads. Additionally, fine-grained models allow deployers to reduce the number of routed experts, both activated counts and total counts, raising the question of how this reduction affects the trade-off between MoE efficiency and performance. Our findings indicate that while deploying MoE models presents greater challenges, it also offers significant optimization opportunities. Reducing the number of activated experts can lead to substantial efficiency improvements in certain scenarios, with only minor performance degradation. Reducing the total number of experts provides limited efficiency gains but results in severe performance degradation. Our method can increase throughput by at least 10\% without any performance degradation. Overall, we conclude that MoE inference optimization remains an area with substantial potential for exploration and improvement.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03531.pdf,"Haoqi Yang, Luohe Shi, Qiwei Li, Zuchao Li, Ping Wang, Bo Du, Mengjia Shen, Hai Zhao",cs.CL
Small-Scale-Fading-Aware Resource Allocation in Wireless Federated Learning,"Judicious resource allocation can effectively enhance federated learning (FL) training performance in wireless networks by addressing both system and statistical heterogeneity. However, existing strategies typically rely on block fading assumptions, which overlooks rapid channel fluctuations within each round of FL gradient uploading, leading to a degradation in FL training performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a small-scale-fading-aware resource allocation strategy using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. Specifically, we establish a one-step convergence bound of the FL algorithm and formulate the resource allocation problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), which is subsequently solved using the QMIX algorithm. In our framework, each client serves as an agent that dynamically determines spectrum and power allocations within each coherence time slot, based on local observations and a reward derived from the convergence analysis. The MARL setting reduces the dimensionality of the action space and facilitates decentralized decision-making, enhancing the scalability and practicality of the solution. Experimental results demonstrate that our QMIX-based resource allocation strategy significantly outperforms baseline methods across various degrees of statistical heterogeneity. Additionally, ablation studies validate the critical importance of incorporating small-scale fading dynamics, highlighting its role in optimizing FL performance.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03533.pdf,"Jiacheng Wang, Le Liang, Hao Ye, Chongtao Guo, Shi Jin",cs.LG
Beyond Relations: A Case for Elevating to the Entity-Relationship Abstraction,"Spurred by a number of recent trends, we make the case that the relational database systems should urgently move beyond supporting the basic object-relational model and instead embrace a more abstract data model, specifically, the entity-relationship model. We argue that the current RDBMSs don't inherently support sufficient ""logical"" data independence, and that is relegating the database systems to the role of a backend storage system, away from where significant innovation is both happening and is still needed. We present the design of a prototype system (ErbiumDB) that we are building to explore these issues, and discuss some of the key research challenges.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03536.pdf,Amol Deshpande,cs.DB
Automated Action Generation based on Action Field for Robotic Garment Manipulation,"Garment manipulation using robotic systems is a challenging task due to the diverse shapes and deformable nature of fabric. In this paper, we propose a novel method for robotic garment manipulation that significantly improves the accuracy while reducing computational time compared to previous approaches. Our method features an action generator that directly interprets scene images and generates pixel-wise end-effector action vectors using a neural network. The network also predicts a manipulation score map that ranks potential actions, allowing the system to select the most effective action. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our method achieves higher unfolding and alignment performances and faster computation time than previous approaches. Real-world experiments show that the proposed method generalizes well to different garment types and successfully flattens garments.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03537.pdf,"Hu Cheng, Fuyuki Tokuda, Kazuhiro Kosuge",cs.RO
RAIL: Region-Aware Instructive Learning for Semi-Supervised Tooth Segmentation in CBCT,"Semi-supervised learning has become a compelling approach for 3D tooth segmentation from CBCT scans, where labeled data is minimal. However, existing methods still face two persistent challenges: limited corrective supervision in structurally ambiguous or mislabeled regions during supervised training and performance degradation caused by unreliable pseudo-labels on unlabeled data. To address these problems, we propose Region-Aware Instructive Learning (RAIL), a dual-group dual-student, semi-supervised framework. Each group contains two student models guided by a shared teacher network. By alternating training between the two groups, RAIL promotes intergroup knowledge transfer and collaborative region-aware instruction while reducing overfitting to the characteristics of any single model. Specifically, RAIL introduces two instructive mechanisms. Disagreement-Focused Supervision (DFS) Controller improves supervised learning by instructing predictions only within areas where student outputs diverge from both ground truth and the best student, thereby concentrating supervision on structurally ambiguous or mislabeled areas. In the unsupervised phase, Confidence-Aware Learning (CAL) Modulator reinforces agreement in regions with high model certainty while reducing the effect of low-confidence predictions during training. This helps prevent our model from learning unstable patterns and improves the overall reliability of pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on four CBCT tooth segmentation datasets show that RAIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods under limited annotation. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Tournesol-Saturday/RAIL.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03538.pdf,"Chuyu Zhao, Hao Huang, Jiashuo Guo, Ziyu Shen, Zhongwei Zhou, Jie Liu, Zekuan Yu",cs.CV
Panoramic Out-of-Distribution Segmentation,"Panoramic imaging enables capturing 360{\deg} images with an ultra-wide Field-of-View (FoV) for dense omnidirectional perception. However, current panoramic semantic segmentation methods fail to identify outliers, and pinhole Out-of-distribution Segmentation (OoS) models perform unsatisfactorily in the panoramic domain due to background clutter and pixel distortions. To address these issues, we introduce a new task, Panoramic Out-of-distribution Segmentation (PanOoS), achieving OoS for panoramas. Furthermore, we propose the first solution, POS, which adapts to the characteristics of panoramic images through text-guided prompt distribution learning. Specifically, POS integrates a disentanglement strategy designed to materialize the cross-domain generalization capability of CLIP. The proposed Prompt-based Restoration Attention (PRA) optimizes semantic decoding by prompt guidance and self-adaptive correction, while Bilevel Prompt Distribution Learning (BPDL) refines the manifold of per-pixel mask embeddings via semantic prototype supervision. Besides, to compensate for the scarcity of PanOoS datasets, we establish two benchmarks: DenseOoS, which features diverse outliers in complex environments, and QuadOoS, captured by a quadruped robot with a panoramic annular lens system. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of POS, with AuPRC improving by 34.25% and FPR95 decreasing by 21.42% on DenseOoS, outperforming state-of-the-art pinhole-OoS methods. Moreover, POS achieves leading closed-set segmentation capabilities.

Fluid Volume Assignment for Flow-Based Biochips: State-of-the-Art and Research Challenges,"Microfluidic biochips are replacing the conventional biochemical analysers integrating the necessary functions on-chip. We are interested in Flow-Based Microfluidic Biochips (FBMB), where a continuous flow of liquid is manipulated using integrated microvalves. Using microvalves and channels, more complex Fluidic Units (FUs) such as switches, micropumps, mixers and separators can be constructed. When running a biochemical application on a FBMB, fluid volumes are dispensed from input reservoirs and used by the FUs. Given a biochemical application and a biochip, one of the key problems which we are discussing in this paper, is in determining the fluid volume assignment for each operation of the application, such that the FUs' volume requirements are satisfied, while over- and underflow are avoided and the total volume of fluid used is minimized. We illustrate the main problems using examples, and provide a review of related work on volume management. We present algorithms for optimizing fluid volume assignments and for reusing leftover fluids to reduce waste. This also includes the optimization of mixing operations which significantly impact the required fluid volumes. We identify the main challenges related to volume management and discuss possible solutions. Finally we compare the outcome of volume management using fixed- and arbitrary-ratio mixing technology, demonstrating significant reductions in fluid consumption for real biochemical assays.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03540.pdf,"Alexander Schneider, Jan Madsen, Paul Pop",cs.ET

STORY2GAME: Generating (Almost) Everything in an Interactive Fiction Game,"We introduce STORY2GAME, a novel approach to using Large Language Models to generate text-based interactive fiction games that starts by generating a story, populates the world, and builds the code for actions in a game engine that enables the story to play out interactively. Whereas a given set of hard-coded actions can artificially constrain story generation, the ability to generate actions means the story generation process can be more open-ended but still allow for experiences that are grounded in a game state. The key to successful action generation is to use LLM-generated preconditions and effects of actions in the stories as guides for what aspects of the game state must be tracked and changed by the game engine when a player performs an action. We also introduce a technique for dynamically generating new actions to accommodate the player's desire to perform actions that they think of that are not part of the story. Dynamic action generation may require on-the-fly updates to the game engine's state representation and revision of previously generated actions. We evaluate the success rate of action code generation with respect to whether a player can interactively play through the entire generated story.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03547.pdf,"Eric Zhou, Shreyas Basavatia, Moontashir Siam, Zexin Chen, Mark O.

Efficient Training of Physics-enhanced Neural ODEs via Direct Collocation and Nonlinear Programming,"We propose a novel approach for training Physics-enhanced Neural ODEs (PeNODEs) by expressing the training process as a dynamic optimization problem. The full model, including neural components, is discretized using a high-order implicit Runge-Kutta method with flipped Legendre-Gauss-Radau points, resulting in a large-scale nonlinear program (NLP) efficiently solved by state-of-the-art NLP solvers such as Ipopt. This formulation enables simultaneous optimization of network parameters and state trajectories, addressing key limitations of ODE solver-based training in terms of stability, runtime, and accuracy. Extending on a recent direct collocation-based method for Neural ODEs, we generalize to PeNODEs, incorporate physical constraints, and present a custom, parallelized, open-source implementation. Benchmarks on a Quarter Vehicle Model and a Van-der-Pol oscillator demonstrate superior accuracy, speed, and generalization with smaller networks compared to other training techniques. We also outline a planned integration into OpenModelica to enable accessible training of Neural DAEs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03552.pdf,"Linus Langenkamp, Philip Hannebohm, Bernhard Bachmann",cs.LG
A Hashgraph-Inspired Consensus Mechanism for Reliable Multi-Model Reasoning,"Inconsistent outputs and hallucinations from large language models (LLMs) are major obstacles to reliable AI systems. When different proprietary reasoning models (RMs), such as those by OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and xAI, are given the same complex request, they often produce divergent results due to variations in training and inference. This paper proposes a novel consensus mechanism, inspired by distributed ledger technology, to validate and converge these outputs, treating each RM as a black-box peer. Building on the Hashgraph consensus algorithm, our approach employs gossip-about-gossip communication and virtual voting to achieve agreement among an ensemble of RMs. We present an architectural design for a prototype system in which RMs iteratively exchange and update their answers, using information from each round to improve accuracy and confidence in subsequent rounds. This approach goes beyond simple majority voting by incorporating the knowledge and cross-verification content of every model. We justify the feasibility of this Hashgraph-inspired consensus for AI ensembles and outline its advantages over traditional ensembling techniques in reducing nonfactual outputs. Preliminary considerations for implementation, evaluation criteria for convergence and accuracy, and potential challenges are discussed. The proposed mechanism demonstrates a promising direction for multi-agent AI systems to self-validate and deliver high-fidelity responses in complex tasks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03553.pdf,"Kolawole E.

Read My Ears! Horse Ear Movement Detection for Equine Affective State Assessment,"The Equine Facial Action Coding System (EquiFACS) enables the systematic annotation of facial movements through distinct Action Units (AUs). It serves as a crucial tool for assessing affective states in horses by identifying subtle facial expressions associated with discomfort. However, the field of horse affective state assessment is constrained by the scarcity of annotated data, as manually labelling facial AUs is both time-consuming and costly. To address this challenge, automated annotation systems are essential for leveraging existing datasets and improving affective states detection tools. In this work, we study different methods for specific ear AU detection and localization from horse videos. We leverage past works on deep learning-based video feature extraction combined with recurrent neural networks for the video classification task, as well as a classic optical flow based approach. We achieve 87.5% classification accuracy of ear movement presence on a public horse video dataset, demonstrating the potential of our approach. We discuss future directions to develop these systems, with the aim of bridging the gap between automated AU detection and practical applications in equine welfare and veterinary diagnostics.

Empc: Effective Path Prioritization for Symbolic Execution with Path Cover,"Symbolic execution is a powerful program analysis technique that can formally reason the correctness of program behaviors and detect software bugs. It can systematically explore the execution paths of the tested program. But it suffers from an inherent limitation: path explosion. Path explosion occurs when symbolic execution encounters an overwhelming number (exponential to the program size) of paths that need to be symbolically reasoned. It severely impacts the scalability and performance of symbolic execution. To tackle this problem, previous works leverage various heuristics to prioritize paths for symbolic execution. They rank the exponential number of paths using static rules or heuristics and explore the paths with the highest rank. However, in practice, these works often fail to generalize to diverse programs. In this work, we propose a novel and effective path prioritization technique with path cover, named Empc. Our key insight is that not all paths need to be symbolically reasoned. Unlike traditional path prioritization, our approach leverages a small subset of paths as a minimum path cover (MPC) that can cover all code regions of the tested programs. To encourage diversity in path prioritization, we compute multiple MPCs. We then guide the search for symbolic execution on the small number of paths inside multiple MPCs rather than the exponential number of paths. We implement our technique Empc based on KLEE. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of Empc to investigate its performance in code coverage, bug findings, and runtime overhead. The evaluation shows that Empc can cover 19.6% more basic blocks than KLEE's best search strategy and 24.4% more lines compared to the state-of-the-art work cgs. Empc also finds 24 more security violations than KLEE's best search strategy. Meanwhile, Empc can significantly reduce the memory usage of KLEE by up to 93.5%.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03555.pdf,"Shuangjie Yao, Dongdong She",cs.CR
"A Comprehensive Survey of Large AI Models for Future Communications: Foundations, Applications and Challenges","The 6G wireless communications aim to establish an intelligent world of ubiquitous connectivity, providing an unprecedented communication experience. Large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) are characterized by significantly larger scales (e.g., billions or trillions of parameters) compared to typical artificial intelligence (AI) models. LAMs exhibit outstanding cognitive abilities, including strong generalization capabilities for fine-tuning to downstream tasks, and emergent capabilities to handle tasks unseen during training. Therefore, LAMs efficiently provide AI services for diverse communication applications, making them crucial tools for addressing complex challenges in future wireless communication systems. This study provides a comprehensive review of the foundations, applications, and challenges of LAMs in communication. First, we introduce the current state of AI-based communication systems, emphasizing the motivation behind integrating LAMs into communications and summarizing the key contributions. We then present an overview of the essential concepts of LAMs in communication. This includes an introduction to the main architectures of LAMs, such as transformer, diffusion models, and mamba. We also explore the classification of LAMs, including large language models (LLMs), large vision models (LVMs), large multimodal models (LMMs), and world models, and examine their potential applications in communication. Additionally, we cover the training methods and evaluation techniques for LAMs in communication systems. Lastly, we introduce optimization strategies such as chain of thought (CoT), retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and agentic systems. Following this, we discuss the research advancements of LAMs across various communication scenarios. Finally, we analyze the challenges in the current research and provide insights into potential future research directions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03556.pdf,"Feibo Jiang, Cunhua Pan, Li Dong, Kezhi Wang, Merouane Debbah, Dusit Niyato, Zhu Han",cs.IT

This paper investigates the impact of augmentations on improving facial resemblance when using two prominent personalization techniques: DreamBooth and InstantID. Through a series of experiments with diverse subject datasets, we assessed the effectiveness of various augmentation strategies on the generated headshots' fidelity to the original subject. We introduce FaceDistance, a wrapper around FaceNet, to rank the generations based on facial similarity, which aided in our assessment.

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Scheduling to Support Low Latency in Teleoperated Driving,"The teleoperated driving (TD) scenario comes with stringent Quality of Service (QoS) communication constraints, especially in terms of end-to-end (E2E) latency and reliability. In this context, Predictive Quality of Service (PQoS), possibly combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques, is a powerful tool to estimate QoS degradation and react accordingly. For example, an intelligent agent can be trained to select the optimal compression configuration for automotive data, and reduce the file size whenever QoS conditions deteriorate. However, compression may inevitably compromise data quality, with negative implications for the TD application. An alternative strategy involves operating at the Radio Access Network (RAN) level to optimize radio parameters based on current network conditions, while preserving data quality. In this paper, we propose Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) scheduling algorithms, based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to dynamically and intelligently allocate radio resources to minimize E2E latency in a TD scenario. We evaluate two training paradigms, i.e., decentralized learning with local observations (IPPO) vs. centralized aggregation (MAPPO), in conjunction with two resource allocation strategies, i.e., proportional allocation (PA) and greedy allocation (GA). We prove via ns-3 simulations that MAPPO, combined with GA, achieves the best results in terms of latency, especially as the number of vehicles increases.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03558.pdf,"Giacomo Avanzi, Marco Giordani, Michele Zorzi",cs.NI
"Event-Triggered GAT-LSTM Framework for Attack Detection in Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning Systems","Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems are essential for maintaining indoor environmental quality, but their interconnected nature and reliance on sensor networks make them vulnerable to cyber-physical attacks. Such attacks can interrupt system operations and risk leaking sensitive personal information through measurement data. In this paper, we propose a novel attack detection framework for HVAC systems, integrating an Event-Triggering Unit (ETU) for local monitoring and a cloud-based classification system using the Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The ETU performs a binary classification to identify potential anomalies and selectively triggers encrypted data transmission to the cloud, significantly reducing communication cost. The cloud-side GAT module models the spatial relationships among HVAC components, while the LSTM module captures temporal dependencies across encrypted state sequences to classify the attack type. Our approach is evaluated on datasets that simulate diverse attack scenarios. Compared to GAT-only (94.2% accuracy) and LSTM-only (91.5%) ablations, our full GAT-LSTM model achieves 98.8% overall detection accuracy and reduces data transmission to 15%. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves high detection accuracy while preserving data privacy by using the spatial-temporal characteristics of HVAC systems and minimizing transmission costs through event-triggered communication.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03559.pdf,"Zhenan Feng, Ehsan Nekouei",eess.SY
Rapid AI-based generation of coverage paths for dispensing applications,"Coverage Path Planning of Thermal Interface Materials (TIM) plays a crucial role in the design of power electronics and electronic control units. Up to now, this is done manually by experts or by using optimization approaches with a high computational effort. We propose a novel AI-based approach to generate dispense paths for TIM and similar dispensing applications. It is a drop-in replacement for optimization-based approaches. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) receives the target cooling area as input and directly outputs the dispense path. Our proposed setup does not require labels and we show its feasibility on multiple target areas. The resulting dispense paths can be directly transferred to automated manufacturing equipment and do not exhibit air entrapments. The approach of using an ANN to predict process parameters for a desired target state in real-time could potentially be transferred to other manufacturing processes.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03560.pdf,"Simon Baeuerle, Ian F.

Ergodic Generative Flows,"Generative Flow Networks (GFNs) were initially introduced on directed acyclic graphs to sample from an unnormalized distribution density. Recent works have extended the theoretical framework for generative methods allowing more flexibility and enhancing application range. However, many challenges remain in training GFNs in continuous settings and for imitation learning (IL), including intractability of flow-matching loss, limited tests of non-acyclic training, and the need for a separate reward model in imitation learning. The present work proposes a family of generative flows called Ergodic Generative Flows (EGFs) which are used to address the aforementioned issues. First, we leverage ergodicity to build simple generative flows with finitely many globally defined transformations (diffeomorphisms) with universality guarantees and tractable flow-matching loss (FM loss). Second, we introduce a new loss involving cross-entropy coupled to weak flow-matching control, coined KL-weakFM loss. It is designed for IL training without a separate reward model. We evaluate IL-EGFs on toy 2D tasks and real-world datasets from NASA on the sphere, using the KL-weakFM loss. Additionally, we conduct toy 2D reinforcement learning experiments with a target reward, using the FM loss.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03561.pdf,"Leo Maxime Brunswic, Mateo Clemente, Rui Heng Yang, Adam Sigal, Amir Rasouli, Yinchuan Li",cs.LG
Real-Time Person Image Synthesis Using a Flow Matching Model,"Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis (PGPIS) generates realistic person images conditioned on a target pose and a source image. This task plays a key role in various real-world applications, such as sign language video generation, AR/VR, gaming, and live streaming. In these scenarios, real-time PGPIS is critical for providing immediate visual feedback and maintaining user immersion.However, achieving real-time performance remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of synthesizing high-fidelity images from diverse and dynamic human poses. Recent diffusion-based methods have shown impressive image quality in PGPIS, but their slow sampling speeds hinder deployment in time-sensitive applications. This latency is particularly problematic in tasks like generating sign language videos during live broadcasts, where rapid image updates are required. Therefore, developing a fast and reliable PGPIS model is a crucial step toward enabling real-time interactive systems. To address this challenge, we propose a generative model based on flow matching (FM). Our approach enables faster, more stable, and more efficient training and sampling. Furthermore, the proposed model supports conditional generation and can operate in latent space, making it especially suitable for real-time PGPIS applications where both speed and quality are critical. We evaluate our proposed method, Real-Time Person Image Synthesis Using a Flow Matching Model (RPFM), on the widely used DeepFashion dataset for PGPIS tasks. Our results show that RPFM achieves near-real-time sampling speeds while maintaining performance comparable to the state-of-the-art models. Our methodology trades off a slight, acceptable decrease in generated-image accuracy for over a twofold increase in generation speed, thereby ensuring real-time performance.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03562.pdf,"Jiwoo Jeong, Kirok Kim, Wooju Kim, Nam-Joon Kim",cs.CV
Say It Another Way: A Framework for User-Grounded Paraphrasing,"Small changes in how a prompt is worded can lead to meaningful differences in the behavior of large language models (LLMs), raising concerns about the stability and reliability of their evaluations. While prior work has explored simple formatting changes, these rarely capture the kinds of natural variation seen in real-world language use. We propose a controlled paraphrasing framework based on a taxonomy of minimal linguistic transformations to systematically generate natural prompt variations. Using the BBQ dataset, we validate our method with both human annotations and automated checks, then use it to study how LLMs respond to paraphrased prompts in stereotype evaluation tasks. Our analysis shows that even subtle prompt modifications can lead to substantial changes in model behavior. These results highlight the need for robust, paraphrase-aware evaluation protocols.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03563.pdf,"Cl\'ea Chataigner, Rebecca Ma, Prakhar Ganesh, Afaf Ta\""ik, Elliot Creager, Golnoosh Farnadi",cs.CL
Thermal-LiDAR Fusion for Robust Tunnel Localization in GNSS-Denied and Low-Visibility Conditions,"Despite significant progress in autonomous navigation, a critical gap remains in ensuring reliable localization in hazardous environments such as tunnels, urban disaster zones, and underground structures. Tunnels present a uniquely difficult scenario: they are not only prone to GNSS signal loss, but also provide little features for visual localization due to their repetitive walls and poor lighting. These conditions degrade conventional vision-based and LiDAR-based systems, which rely on distinguishable environmental features. To address this, we propose a novel sensor fusion framework that integrates a thermal camera with a LiDAR to enable robust localization in tunnels and other perceptually degraded environments. The thermal camera provides resilience in low-light or smoke conditions, while the LiDAR delivers precise depth perception and structural awareness. By combining these sensors, our framework ensures continuous and accurate localization across diverse and dynamic environments. We use an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to fuse multi-sensor inputs, and leverages visual odometry and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques to process the sensor data, enabling robust motion estimation and mapping even in GNSS-denied environments. This fusion of sensor modalities not only enhances system resilience but also provides a scalable solution for cyber-physical systems in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). To validate the framework, we conduct tests in a tunnel environment, simulating sensor degradation and visibility challenges. The results demonstrate that our method sustains accurate localization where standard approaches deteriorate due to the tunnels featureless geometry. The frameworks versatility makes it a promising solution for autonomous vehicles, inspection robots, and other cyber-physical systems operating in constrained, perceptually poor environments.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03565.pdf,"Lukas Schichler, Karin Festl, Selim Solmaz, Daniel Watzenig",cs.RO
Uncertainty-Aware Prototype Semantic Decoupling for Text-Based Person Search in Full Images,"Text-based pedestrian search (TBPS) in full images aims to locate a target pedestrian in untrimmed images using natural language descriptions. However, in complex scenes with multiple pedestrians, existing methods are limited by uncertainties in detection and matching, leading to degraded performance. To address this, we propose UPD-TBPS, a novel framework comprising three modules: Multi-granularity Uncertainty Estimation (MUE), Prototype-based Uncertainty Decoupling (PUD), and Cross-modal Re-identification (ReID). MUE conducts multi-granularity queries to identify potential targets and assigns confidence scores to reduce early-stage uncertainty. PUD leverages visual context decoupling and prototype mining to extract features of the target pedestrian described in the query. It separates and learns pedestrian prototype representations at both the coarse-grained cluster level and the fine-grained individual level, thereby reducing matching uncertainty. ReID evaluates candidates with varying confidence levels, improving detection and retrieval accuracy. Experiments on CUHK-SYSU-TBPS and PRW-TBPS datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03567.pdf,"Zengli Luo, Canlong Zhang, Xiaochun Lu, Zhixin Li, Zhiwen Wang",cs.CV
Familiarizing with Music: Discovery Patterns for Different Music Discovery Needs,"Humans have the tendency to discover and explore. This natural tendency is reflected in data from streaming platforms as the amount of previously unknown content accessed by users. Additionally, in domains such as that of music streaming there is evidence that recommending novel content improves users' experience with the platform. Therefore, understanding users' discovery patterns, such as the amount to which and the way users access previously unknown content, is a topic of relevance for both the scientific community and the streaming industry, particularly the music one. Previous works studied how music consumption differs for users of different traits and looked at diversity, novelty, and consistency over time of users' music preferences. However, very little is known about how users discover and explore previously unknown music, and how this behavior differs for users of varying discovery needs. In this paper we bridge this gap by analyzing data from a survey answered by users of the major music streaming platform Deezer in combination with their streaming data. We first address questions regarding whether users who declare a higher interest in unfamiliar music listen to more diverse music, have more stable music preferences over time, and explore more music within a same time window, compared to those who declare a lower interest. We then investigate which type of music tracks users choose to listen to when they explore unfamiliar music, identifying clear patterns of popularity and genre representativeness that vary for users of different discovery needs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03568.pdf,"Marta Moscati, Darius Afchar, Markus Schedl, Bruno Sguerra",cs.IR
Corner Cases: How Size and Position of Objects Challenge ImageNet-Trained Models,"Backgrounds in images play a major role in contributing to spurious correlations among different data points. Owing to aesthetic preferences of humans capturing the images, datasets can exhibit positional (location of the object within a given frame) and size (region-of-interest to image ratio) biases for different classes. In this paper, we show that these biases can impact how much a model relies on spurious features in the background to make its predictions. To better illustrate our findings, we propose a synthetic dataset derived from ImageNet1k, Hard-Spurious-ImageNet, which contains images with various backgrounds, object positions, and object sizes. By evaluating the dataset on different pretrained models, we find that most models rely heavily on spurious features in the background when the region-of-interest (ROI) to image ratio is small and the object is far from the center of the image. Moreover, we also show that current methods that aim to mitigate harmful spurious features, do not take into account these factors, hence fail to achieve considerable performance gains for worst-group accuracies when the size and location of core features in an image change.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03569.pdf,"Mishal Fatima, Steffen Jung, Margret Keuper",cs.CV
OSUniverse: Benchmark for Multimodal GUI-navigation AI Agents,"In this paper, we introduce OSUniverse: a benchmark of complex, multimodal desktop-oriented tasks for advanced GUI-navigation AI agents that focuses on ease of use, extensibility, comprehensive coverage of test cases, and automated validation. We divide the tasks in increasing levels of complexity, from basic precision clicking to multistep, multiapplication tests requiring dexterity, precision, and clear thinking from the agent. In version one of the benchmark, presented here, we have calibrated the complexity of the benchmark test cases to ensure that the SOTA (State of the Art) agents (at the time of publication) do not achieve results higher than 50%, while the average white collar worker can perform all these tasks with perfect accuracy. The benchmark can be scored manually, but we also introduce an automated validation mechanism that has an average error rate less than 2%. Therefore, this benchmark presents solid ground for fully automated measuring of progress, capabilities and the effectiveness of GUI-navigation AI agents over the short and medium-term horizon. The source code of the benchmark is available at https://github.com/agentsea/osuniverse.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03570.pdf,"Mariya Davydova, Daniel Jeffries, Patrick Barker, Arturo M\'arquez Flores, Sin\'ead Ryan",cs.AI
Troika algorithm: approximate optimization for accurate clique partitioning and clustering of weighted networks,"Clique partitioning is a fundamental network clustering task, with applications in a wide range of computational sciences. It involves identifying an optimal partition of the nodes for a real-valued weighted graph according to the edge weights. An optimal partition is one that maximizes the sum of within-cluster edge weights over all possible node partitions. This paper introduces a novel approximation algorithm named Troika to solve this NP-hard problem in small to mid-sized networks for instances of theoretical and practical relevance. Troika uses a branch-and-cut scheme for branching on node triples to find a partition that is within a user-specified optimality gap tolerance. Troika offers advantages over alternative methods like integer programming solvers and heuristics for clique partitioning. Unlike existing heuristics, Troika returns solutions within a guaranteed proximity to global optimality. And our results indicate that Troika is faster than using the state-of-the-art integer programming solver Gurobi for most benchmark instances. Besides its advantages for solving the clique partitioning problem, we demonstrate the applications of Troika in community detection and portfolio analysis. Troika returns partitions with higher proximity to optimal compared to eight modularity-based community detection algorithms. When used on networks of correlations among stocks, Troika reveals the dynamic changes in the structure of portfolio networks including downturns from the 2008 financial crisis and the reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our comprehensive results based on benchmarks from the literature and new real and random networks point to Troika as a reliable and accurate method for solving clique partitioning instances with up to 5000 edges on standard hardware.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03573.pdf,"Samin Aref, Boris Ng",cs.SI
LlamaFirewall: An open source guardrail system for building secure AI agents,"Large language models (LLMs) have evolved from simple chatbots into autonomous agents capable of performing complex tasks such as editing production code, orchestrating workflows, and taking higher-stakes actions based on untrusted inputs like webpages and emails. These capabilities introduce new security risks that existing security measures, such as model fine-tuning or chatbot-focused guardrails, do not fully address. Given the higher stakes and the absence of deterministic solutions to mitigate these risks, there is a critical need for a real-time guardrail monitor to serve as a final layer of defense, and support system level, use case specific safety policy definition and enforcement. We introduce LlamaFirewall, an open-source security focused guardrail framework designed to serve as a final layer of defense against security risks associated with AI Agents. Our framework mitigates risks such as prompt injection, agent misalignment, and insecure code risks through three powerful guardrails: PromptGuard 2, a universal jailbreak detector that demonstrates clear state of the art performance; Agent Alignment Checks, a chain-of-thought auditor that inspects agent reasoning for prompt injection and goal misalignment, which, while still experimental, shows stronger efficacy at preventing indirect injections in general scenarios than previously proposed approaches; and CodeShield, an online static analysis engine that is both fast and extensible, aimed at preventing the generation of insecure or dangerous code by coding agents. Additionally, we include easy-to-use customizable scanners that make it possible for any developer who can write a regular expression or an LLM prompt to quickly update an agent's security guardrails.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03574.pdf,"Sahana Chennabasappa, Cyrus Nikolaidis, Daniel Song, David Molnar, Stephanie Ding, Shengye Wan, Spencer Whitman, Lauren Deason, Nicholas Doucette, Abraham Montilla, Alekhya Gampa, Beto de Paola, Dominik Gabi, James Crnkovich, Jean-Christophe Testud, Kat He, Rashnil Chaturvedi, Wu Zhou, Joshua Saxe",cs.CR

DyGEnc: Encoding a Sequence of Textual Scene Graphs to Reason and Answer Questions in Dynamic Scenes,"The analysis of events in dynamic environments poses a fundamental challenge in the development of intelligent agents and robots capable of interacting with humans. Current approaches predominantly utilize visual models. However, these methods often capture information implicitly from images, lacking interpretable spatial-temporal object representations. To address this issue we introduce DyGEnc - a novel method for Encoding a Dynamic Graph. This method integrates compressed spatial-temporal structural observation representation with the cognitive capabilities of large language models. The purpose of this integration is to enable advanced question answering based on a sequence of textual scene graphs. Extended evaluations on the STAR and AGQA datasets indicate that DyGEnc outperforms existing visual methods by a large margin of 15-25% in addressing queries regarding the history of human-to-object interactions. Furthermore, the proposed method can be seamlessly extended to process raw input images utilizing foundational models for extracting explicit textual scene graphs, as substantiated by the results of a robotic experiment conducted with a wheeled manipulator platform. We hope that these findings will contribute to the implementation of robust and compressed graph-based robotic memory for long-horizon reasoning.

BCause: Human-AI collaboration to improve hybrid mapping and ideation in argumentation-grounded deliberation,"Public deliberation, as in open discussion of issues of public concern, often suffers from scattered and shallow discourse, poor sensemaking, and a disconnect from actionable policy outcomes. This paper introduces BCause, a discussion system leveraging generative AI and human-machine collaboration to transform unstructured dialogue around public issues (such as urban living, policy changes, and current socio-economic transformations) into structured, actionable democratic processes. We present three innovations: (i) importing and transforming unstructured transcripts into argumentative discussions, (ii) geo-deliberated problem-sensing via a Telegram bot for local issue reporting, and (iii) smart reporting with customizable widgets (e.g., summaries, topic modelling, policy recommendations, clustered arguments).

Rainbow Delay Compensation: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Mitigating Delayed Observation,"In real-world multi-agent systems (MASs), observation delays are ubiquitous, preventing agents from making decisions based on the environment's true state. An individual agent's local observation often consists of multiple components from other agents or dynamic entities in the environment. These discrete observation components with varying delay characteristics pose significant challenges for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). In this paper, we first formulate the decentralized stochastic individual delay partially observable Markov decision process (DSID-POMDP) by extending the standard Dec-POMDP. We then propose the Rainbow Delay Compensation (RDC), a MARL training framework for addressing stochastic individual delays, along with recommended implementations for its constituent modules. We implement the DSID-POMDP's observation generation pattern using standard MARL benchmarks, including MPE and SMAC. Experiments demonstrate that baseline MARL methods suffer severe performance degradation under fixed and unfixed delays. The RDC-enhanced approach mitigates this issue, remarkably achieving ideal delay-free performance in certain delay scenarios while maintaining generalization capability. Our work provides a novel perspective on multi-agent delayed observation problems and offers an effective solution framework.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03586.pdf,"Songchen Fu, Siang Chen, Shaojing Zhao, Letian Bai, Ta Li, Yonghong Yan",cs.MA
Meta-reasoning Using Attention Maps and Its Applications in Cloud Robotics,"Metareasoning, a branch of AI, focuses on reasoning about reasons. It has the potential to enhance robots' decision-making processes in unexpected situations. However, the concept has largely been confined to theoretical discussions and case-by-case investigations, lacking general and practical solutions when the Value of Computation (VoC) is undefined, which is common in unexpected situations. In this work, we propose a revised meta-reasoning framework that significantly improves the scalability of the original approach in unexpected situations. This is achieved by incorporating semantic attention maps and unsupervised 'attention' updates into the metareasoning processes. To accommodate environmental dynamics, 'lines of thought' are used to bridge context-specific objects with abstracted attentions, while meta-information is monitored and controlled at the meta-level for effective reasoning. The practicality of the proposed approach is demonstrated through cloud robots deployed in real-world scenarios, showing improved performance and robustness.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03587.pdf,"Adrian Lendinez, Renxi Qiu, Lanfranco Zanzi, Dayou Li",cs.RO
A Unifying Bias-aware Multidisciplinary Framework for Investigating Socio-Technical Issues,"This paper aims to bring together the disciplines of social science (SS) and computer science (CS) in the design and implementation of a novel multidisciplinary framework for systematic, transparent, ethically-informed, and bias-aware investigation of socio-technical issues. For this, various analysis approaches from social science and machine learning (ML) were applied in a structured sequence to arrive at an original methodology of identifying and quantifying objects of inquiry. A core feature of this framework is that it highlights where bias occurs and suggests possible steps to mitigate it. This is to improve the robustness, reliability, and explainability of the framework and its results. Such an approach also ensures that the investigation of socio-technical issues is transparent about its own limitations and potential sources of bias. To test our framework, we utilised it in the multidisciplinary investigation of the online harms encountered by minoritised ethnic (ME) communities when accessing and using digitalised social housing services in the UK. We draw our findings from 100 interviews with ME individuals in four cities across the UK to understand ME vulnerabilities when accessing and using digitalised social housing services. In our framework, a sub-sample of interviews focusing on ME individuals residing in social housing units were inductively coded. This resulted in the identification of the topics of discrimination, digital poverty, lack of digital literacy, and lack of English proficiency as key vulnerabilities of ME communities. Further ML techniques such as Topic Modelling and Sentiment Analysis were used within our framework where we found that Black African communities are more likely to experience these vulnerabilities in the access, use and outcome of digitalised social housing services.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03593.pdf,"Sacha Hasan, Mehdi Rizvi, Yingfang Yuan, Kefan Chen, Lynne Baillie, Wei Pang",cs.CY
Artificial Potential Field and Sliding Mode Control for Spacecraft Attitude Maneuver with Actuation and Pointing Constraints,"This study investigates the combination of guidance and control strategies for rigid spacecraft attitude reorientation, while dealing with forbidden pointing constraints, actuator limitations, and system uncertainties. These constraints arise due to the presence of bright objects in space that may damage sensitive payloads onboard the spacecraft, and the risk that actuator saturations may compromise closed-loop system stability. Furthermore, spacecraft attitude dynamics are typically affected by parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, and system nonlinearities, which cannot be neglected. In this article, the problem of spacecraft reorientation under pointing and actuation constraints is addressed using a strategy that combines Artificial Potential Field (APF) and Sliding Mode Control (SMC). A rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis yields closed-form expressions for APF/SMC gains, providing explicit mathematical formulas for gain values without the need for iterative computations. These expressions account for angular velocity and control torque limitations, external disturbances, and inertia uncertainties. The robustness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated through Monte Carlo simulations using a high-fidelity attitude dynamics simulator. Additionally, mu-analysis is employed to assess local stability properties and quantify robustness margins. The results confirm the practical feasibility of the proposed method in real-world space scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness in uncertain and constrained environments.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03594.pdf,"Mauro Mancini, Dario Ruggiero",eess.SY
Anant-Net: Breaking the Curse of Dimensionality with Scalable and Interpretable Neural Surrogate for High-Dimensional PDEs,"High-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) arise in diverse scientific and engineering applications but remain computationally intractable due to the curse of dimensionality. Traditional numerical methods struggle with the exponential growth in computational complexity, particularly on hypercubic domains, where the number of required collocation points increases rapidly with dimensionality. Here, we introduce Anant-Net, an efficient neural surrogate that overcomes this challenge, enabling the solution of PDEs in high dimensions. Unlike hyperspheres, where the internal volume diminishes as dimensionality increases, hypercubes retain or expand their volume (for unit or larger length), making high-dimensional computations significantly more demanding. Anant-Net efficiently incorporates high-dimensional boundary conditions and minimizes the PDE residual at high-dimensional collocation points. To enhance interpretability, we integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold networks into the Anant-Net architecture. We benchmark Anant-Net's performance on several linear and nonlinear high-dimensional equations, including the Poisson, Sine-Gordon, and Allen-Cahn equations, demonstrating high accuracy and robustness across randomly sampled test points from high-dimensional space. Importantly, Anant-Net achieves these results with remarkable efficiency, solving 300-dimensional problems on a single GPU within a few hours. We also compare Anant-Net's results for accuracy and runtime with other state-of-the-art methods. Our findings establish Anant-Net as an accurate, interpretable, and scalable framework for efficiently solving high-dimensional PDEs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03595.pdf,"Sidharth S.

Dynamic load balancing for cloud systems under heterogeneous setup delays,"We consider a distributed cloud service deployed at a set of distinct server pools. Arriving jobs are classified into heterogeneous types, in accordance with their setup times which are differentiated at each of the pools. A dispatcher for each job type controls the balance of load between pools, based on decentralized feedback. The system of rates and queues is modeled by a fluid differential equation system, and analyzed via convex optimization. A first, myopic policy is proposed, based on task delay-to-service. Under a simplified dynamic fluid queue model, we prove global convergence to an equilibrium point which minimizes the mean setup time; however queueing delays are incurred with this method. A second proposal is then developed based on proximal optimization, which explicitly models the setup queue and is proved to reach an optimal equilibrium, devoid of queueing delay. Results are demonstrated through a simulation example.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03596.pdf,"Fernando Paganini, Diego Goldsztajn",eess.SY
Fixed-Length Dense Fingerprint Representation,"Fixed-length fingerprint representations, which map each fingerprint to a compact and fixed-size feature vector, are computationally efficient and well-suited for large-scale matching. However, designing a robust representation that effectively handles diverse fingerprint modalities, pose variations, and noise interference remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a fixed-length dense descriptor of fingerprints, and introduce FLARE-a fingerprint matching framework that integrates the Fixed-Length dense descriptor with pose-based Alignment and Robust Enhancement. This fixed-length representation employs a three-dimensional dense descriptor to effectively capture spatial relationships among fingerprint ridge structures, enabling robust and locally discriminative representations. To ensure consistency within this dense feature space, FLARE incorporates pose-based alignment using complementary estimation methods, along with dual enhancement strategies that refine ridge clarity while preserving the original fingerprint modality. The proposed dense descriptor supports fixed-length representation while maintaining spatial correspondence, enabling fast and accurate similarity computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FLARE achieves superior performance across rolled, plain, latent, and contactless fingerprints, significantly outperforming existing methods in cross-modality and low-quality scenarios. Further analysis validates the effectiveness of the dense descriptor design, as well as the impact of alignment and enhancement modules on the accuracy of dense descriptor matching. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of FLARE as a unified and scalable solution for robust fingerprint representation and matching. The implementation and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Yu-Yy/FLARE.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03597.pdf,"Zhiyu Pan, Xiongjun Guan, Yongjie Duan, Jianjiang Feng, Jie Zhou",cs.CV
An Enriched Immersed Finite Element Method for 3D Interface Problems,"We introduce an enriched immersed finite element method for addressing interface problems characterized by general non-homogeneous jump conditions. Unlike many existing unfitted mesh methods, our approach incorporates a homogenization concept. The IFE trial function set is composed of two components: the standard homogeneous IFE space and additional enrichment IFE functions. These enrichment functions are directly determined by the jump data, without adding extra degrees of freedom to the system. Meanwhile, the homogeneous IFE space is isomorphic to the standard finite element space on the same mesh. This isomorphism remains stable regardless of interface location relative to the mesh, ensuring optimal $\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ conditioning that is independent of the interface location and facilitates an immediate development of a multigrid fast solver; namely the iteration numbers are independent of not only the mesh size but also the relative interface location. Theoretical analysis and extensive numerical experiments are carried out in the efforts to demonstrate these features.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03598.pdf,"Ruchi Guo, Xu Zhang",math.NA
From Pixels to Polygons: A Survey of Deep Learning Approaches for Medical Image-to-Mesh Reconstruction,"Deep learning-based medical image-to-mesh reconstruction has rapidly evolved, enabling the transformation of medical imaging data into three-dimensional mesh models that are critical in computational medicine and in silico trials for advancing our understanding of disease mechanisms, and diagnostic and therapeutic techniques in modern medicine. This survey systematically categorizes existing approaches into four main categories: template models, statistical models, generative models, and implicit models. Each category is analysed in detail, examining their methodological foundations, strengths, limitations, and applicability to different anatomical structures and imaging modalities. We provide an extensive evaluation of these methods across various anatomical applications, from cardiac imaging to neurological studies, supported by quantitative comparisons using standard metrics. Additionally, we compile and analyze major public datasets available for medical mesh reconstruction tasks and discuss commonly used evaluation metrics and loss functions.

"TailBench++: Flexible Multi-Client, Multi-Server Benchmarking for Latency-Critical Workloads","Cloud systems have rapidly expanded worldwide in the last decade, shifting computational tasks to cloud servers where clients submit their requests. Among cloud workloads, latency-critical applications -- characterized by high-percentile response times -- have gained special interest. These applications are present in modern services, representing an important fraction of cloud workloads. This work analyzes common cloud benchmarking suites and identifies TailBench as the most suitable to assess cloud performance with latency-critical workloads. Unfortunately, this suite presents key limitations, especially in multi-server scenarios or environments with variable client arrival patterns and fluctuating loads. To address these limitations, we propose TailBench++, an enhanced benchmark suite that extends TailBench to enable cloud evaluation studies to be performed in dynamic multi-client, multi-server environments. It allows reproducing experiments with varying client arrival times, dynamic query per second (QPS) fluctuations, and multiple servers handling requests. Case studies show that TailBench++ enables more realistic evaluations by capturing a wider range of real-world scenarios.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03600.pdf,"Zhilin Li, Lucia Pons, Salvador Petit, Julio Sahuquillo, Julio Pons",cs.DC
Doing Audits Right? The Role of Sampling and Legal Content Analysis in Systemic Risk Assessments and Independent Audits in the Digital Services Act,"A central requirement of the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) is that online platforms undergo internal and external audits. A key component of these audits is the assessment of systemic risks, including the dissemination of illegal content, threats to fundamental rights, impacts on democratic processes, and gender-based violence. The DSA Delegated Regulation outlines how such audits should be conducted, setting expectations for both platforms and auditors. This article evaluates the strengths and limitations of different qualitative and quantitative methods for auditing these systemic risks and proposes a mixed-method approach for DSA compliance. We argue that content sampling, combined with legal and empirical analysis, offers a viable method for risk-specific audits. First, we examine relevant legal provisions on sample selection for audit purposes. We then assess sampling techniques and methods suitable for detecting systemic risks, focusing on how representativeness can be understood across disciplines. Finally, we review initial systemic risk assessment reports submitted by platforms, analyzing their testing and sampling methodologies. By proposing a structured, mixed-method approach tailored to specific risk categories and platform characteristics, this article addresses the challenge of evidence-based audits under the DSA. Our contribution emphasizes the need for adaptable, context-sensitive auditing strategies and adds to the emerging field of DSA compliance research.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03601.pdf,"Marie-Therese Sekwenz, Rita Gsenger, Scott Dahlgren, Ben Wagner",cs.CY
PAHA: Parts-Aware Audio-Driven Human Animation with Diffusion Model,"Audio-driven human animation technology is widely used in human-computer interaction, and the emergence of diffusion models has further advanced its development. Currently, most methods rely on multi-stage generation and intermediate representations, resulting in long inference time and issues with generation quality in specific foreground regions and audio-motion consistency. These shortcomings are primarily due to the lack of localized fine-grained supervised guidance. To address above challenges, we propose PAHA, an end-to-end audio-driven upper-body human animation framework with diffusion model. We introduce two key methods: Parts-Aware Re-weighting (PAR) and Parts Consistency Enhancement (PCE). PAR dynamically adjusts regional training loss weights based on pose confidence scores, effectively improving visual quality. PCE constructs and trains diffusion-based regional audio-visual classifiers to improve the consistency of motion and co-speech audio. Afterwards, we design two novel inference guidance methods for the foregoing classifiers, Sequential Guidance (SG) and Differential Guidance (DG), to balance efficiency and quality respectively. Additionally, we build CNAS, the first public Chinese News Anchor Speech dataset, to advance research and validation in this field. Extensive experimental results and user studies demonstrate that PAHA significantly outperforms existing methods in audio-motion alignment and video-related evaluations. The codes and CNAS dataset will be released upon acceptance.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03603.pdf,"Y. B. Wang, S. Z. Zhou, J. F. Wu, T. Hu, J. N. Zhang, Y. Liu",cs.CV
Learning Knowledge-based Prompts for Robust 3D Mask Presentation Attack Detection,"3D mask presentation attack detection is crucial for protecting face recognition systems against the rising threat of 3D mask attacks. While most existing methods utilize multimodal features or remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals to distinguish between real faces and 3D masks, they face significant challenges, such as the high costs associated with multimodal sensors and limited generalization ability. Detection-related text descriptions offer concise, universal information and are cost-effective to obtain. However, the potential of vision-language multimodal features for 3D mask presentation attack detection remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge-based prompt learning framework to explore the strong generalization capability of vision-language models for 3D mask presentation attack detection. Specifically, our approach incorporates entities and triples from knowledge graphs into the prompt learning process, generating fine-grained, task-specific explicit prompts that effectively harness the knowledge embedded in pre-trained vision-language models. Furthermore, considering different input images may emphasize distinct knowledge graph elements, we introduce a visual-specific knowledge filter based on an attention mechanism to refine relevant elements according to the visual context. Additionally, we leverage causal graph theory insights into the prompt learning process to further enhance the generalization ability of our method. During training, a spurious correlation elimination paradigm is employed, which removes category-irrelevant local image patches using guidance from knowledge-based text features, fostering the learning of generalized causal prompts that align with category-relevant local patches. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art intra- and cross-scenario detection performance on benchmark datasets.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03610.pdf,"Fangling Jiang, Qi Li, Bing Liu, Weining Wang, Caifeng Shan, Zhenan Sun, Ming-Hsuan Yang",cs.CV
Learning Unknown Spoof Prompts for Generalized Face Anti-Spoofing Using Only Real Face Images,"Face anti-spoofing is a critical technology for ensuring the security of face recognition systems. However, its ability to generalize across diverse scenarios remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we attribute the limited generalization ability to two key factors: covariate shift, which arises from external data collection variations, and semantic shift, which results from substantial differences in emerging attack types. To address both challenges, we propose a novel approach for learning unknown spoof prompts, relying solely on real face images from a single source domain. Our method generates textual prompts for real faces and potential unknown spoof attacks by leveraging the general knowledge embedded in vision-language models, thereby enhancing the model's ability to generalize to unseen target domains. Specifically, we introduce a diverse spoof prompt optimization framework to learn effective prompts. This framework constrains unknown spoof prompts within a relaxed prior knowledge space while maximizing their distance from real face images. Moreover, it enforces semantic independence among different spoof prompts to capture a broad range of spoof patterns. Experimental results on nine datasets demonstrate that the learned prompts effectively transfer the knowledge of vision-language models, enabling state-of-the-art generalization ability against diverse unknown attack types across unseen target domains without using any spoof face images.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03611.pdf,"Fangling Jiang, Qi Li, Weining Wang, Wei Shen, Bing Liu, Zhenan Sun",cs.CV
Backstepping Reach-avoid Controller Synthesis for Multi-input Multi-output Systems with Mixed Relative Degrees,"Designing controllers with provable formal guarantees has become an urgent requirement for cyber-physical systems in safety-critical scenarios. Beyond addressing scalability in high-dimensional implementations, controller synthesis methodologies separating safety and reachability objectives may risk optimization infeasibility due to conflicting constraints, thereby significantly undermining their applicability in practical applications. In this paper, by leveraging feedback linearization and backstepping techniques, we present a novel framework for constructing provable reach-avoid formal certificates tailored to multi-input multi-output systems. Based on this, we developed a systematic synthesis approach for controllers with reach-avoid guarantees, which ensures that the outputs of the system eventually enter the predefined target set while staying within the required safe set. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03612.pdf,"Jianqiang Ding, Dingran Yuan, Shankar A. Deka",eess.SY
Understand the Effect of Importance Weighting in Deep Learning on Dataset Shift,"We evaluate the effectiveness of importance weighting in deep neural networks under label shift and covariate shift. On synthetic 2D data (linearly separable and moon-shaped) using logistic regression and MLPs, we observe that weighting strongly affects decision boundaries early in training but fades with prolonged optimization. On CIFAR-10 with various class imbalances, only L2 regularization (not dropout) helps preserve weighting effects. In a covariate-shift experiment, importance weighting yields no significant performance gain, highlighting challenges on complex data. Our results call into question the practical utility of importance weighting for real-world distribution shifts.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03617.pdf,"Thien Nhan Vo, Thanh Xuan Truong",cs.LG
Scalable Class-Centric Visual Interactive Labeling,"Large unlabeled datasets demand efficient and scalable data labeling solutions, in particular when the number of instances and classes is large. This leads to significant visual scalability challenges and imposes a high cognitive load on the users. Traditional instance-centric labeling methods, where (single) instances are labeled in each iteration struggle to scale effectively in these scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce cVIL, a Class-Centric Visual Interactive Labeling methodology designed for interactive visual data labeling. By shifting the paradigm from assigning-classes-to-instances to assigning-instances-to-classes, cVIL reduces labeling effort and enhances efficiency for annotators working with large, complex and class-rich datasets. We propose a novel visual analytics labeling interface built on top of the conceptual cVIL workflow, enabling improved scalability over traditional visual labeling. In a user study, we demonstrate that cVIL can improve labeling efficiency and user satisfaction over instance-centric interfaces. The effectiveness of cVIL is further demonstrated through a usage scenario, showcasing its potential to alleviate cognitive load and support experts in managing extensive labeling tasks efficiently.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03618.pdf,"Matthias Matt, Jana Sedlakova, J\""urgen Bernard, Matthias Zeppelzauer, Manuela Waldner",cs.HC
PhysLLM: Harnessing Large Language Models for Cross-Modal Remote Physiological Sensing,"Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables non-contact physiological measurement but remains highly susceptible to illumination changes, motion artifacts, and limited temporal modeling. Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at capturing long-range dependencies, offering a potential solution but struggle with the continuous, noise-sensitive nature of rPPG signals due to their text-centric design. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhysLLM, a collaborative optimization framework that synergizes LLMs with domain-specific rPPG components. Specifically, the Text Prototype Guidance (TPG) strategy is proposed to establish cross-modal alignment by projecting hemodynamic features into LLM-interpretable semantic space, effectively bridging the representational gap between physiological signals and linguistic tokens. Besides, a novel Dual-Domain Stationary (DDS) Algorithm is proposed for resolving signal instability through adaptive time-frequency domain feature re-weighting. Finally, rPPG task-specific cues systematically inject physiological priors through physiological statistics, environmental contextual answering, and task description, leveraging cross-modal learning to integrate both visual and textual information, enabling dynamic adaptation to challenging scenarios like variable illumination and subject movements. Evaluation on four benchmark datasets, PhysLLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness, demonstrating superior generalization across lighting variations and motion scenarios.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03621.pdf,"Yiping Xie, Bo Zhao, Mingtong Dai, Jian-Ping Zhou, Yue Sun, Tao Tan, Weicheng Xie, Linlin Shen, Zitong Yu",cs.CV
Bounding Box-Guided Diffusion for Synthesizing Industrial Images and Segmentation Map,"Synthetic dataset generation in Computer Vision, particularly for industrial applications, is still underexplored. Industrial defect segmentation, for instance, requires highly accurate labels, yet acquiring such data is costly and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose a novel diffusion-based pipeline for generating high-fidelity industrial datasets with minimal supervision. Our approach conditions the diffusion model on enriched bounding box representations to produce precise segmentation masks, ensuring realistic and accurately localized defect synthesis. Compared to existing layout-conditioned generative methods, our approach improves defect consistency and spatial accuracy.

ATRAF-driven IMRaD Methodology: Tradeoff and Risk Analysis of Software Architectures Across Abstraction Levels,"Software architecture research relies on key architectural artifacts -- Software Architectures, Reference Architectures, and Architectural Frameworks -- that underpin the design and analysis of complex systems. Evaluating these artifacts is essential to assess tradeoffs and risks affecting quality attributes such as performance, modifiability, and security. Although methodologies like the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) support software architecture evaluation, their industrial focus misaligns with the IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion) format prevalent in academic research, impeding transparency and reproducibility. Our prior work introduced the Architecture Tradeoff and Risk Analysis Framework (ATRAF), extending ATAM through three methods -- ATRAM, RATRAM, and AFTRAM, addressing all abstraction levels, using a unified, iterative four-phase spiral model. These phases -- Scenario and Requirements Gathering, Architectural Views and Scenario Realization, Attribute-Specific Analyses, and Sensitivity, Tradeoff, and Risk Analysis -- ensure traceability and coherence. This paper presents the ATRAF-driven IMRaD Methodology, a concise method to align ATRAF's phases with IMRaD sections. This methodology enhances the rigor, transparency, and accessibility of software architecture research, enabling systematic reporting of complex evaluations.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03624.pdf,Amine Ben Hassouna,cs.SE
Numerical Reconstruction and Analysis of Backward Semilinear Subdiffusion Problems,"This paper aims to develop and analyze a numerical scheme for solving the backward problem of semilinear subdiffusion equations. We establish the existence, uniqueness, and conditional stability of the solution to the inverse problem by applying the smoothing and asymptotic properties of solution operators and constructing a fixed-point iteration. This derived conditional stability further inspires a numerical reconstruction scheme. To address the mildly ill-posed nature of the problem, we employ the quasi-boundary value method for regularization. A fully discrete scheme is proposed, utilizing the finite element method for spatial discretization and convolution quadrature for temporal discretization. A thorough error analysis of the resulting discrete system is provided for both smooth and nonsmooth data. This analysis relies on the smoothing properties of discrete solution operators, some nonstandard error estimates optimal with respect to data regularity in the direct problem, and the arguments used in stability analysis. The derived a priori error estimate offers guidance for selecting the regularization parameter and discretization parameters based on the noise level. Moreover, we propose an easy-to-implement iterative algorithm for solving the fully discrete scheme and prove its linear convergence. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical estimates and demonstrate the necessity of the assumption required in the analysis.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03625.pdf,"Xu Wu, Jiang Yang, Zhi Zhou",math.NA
Revisiting Lower Bounds for Two-Step Consensus,"A seminal result by Lamport shows that at least $\max\{2e+f+1,2f+1\}$ processes are required to implement partially synchronous consensus that tolerates $f$ process failures and can furthermore decide in two message delays under $e$ failures. This lower bound is matched by the classical Fast Paxos protocol. However, more recent practical protocols, such as Egalitarian Paxos, provide two-step decisions with fewer processes, seemingly contradicting the lower bound. We show that this discrepancy arises because the classical bound requires two-step decisions under a wide range of scenarios, not all of which are relevant in practice. We propose a more pragmatic condition for which we establish tight bounds on the number of processes required. Interestingly, these bounds depend on whether consensus is implemented as an atomic object or a decision task. For consensus as an object, $\max\{2e+f-1,2f+1\}$ processes are necessary and sufficient for two-step decisions, while for a task the tight bound is $\max\{2e+f, 2f+1\}$.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03627.pdf,"Fedor Ryabinin, Alexey Gotsman, Pierre Sutra",cs.DC
DNA Tails for Molecular Flash Memory,"DNA-based data storage systems face practical challenges due to the high cost of DNA synthesis. A strategy to address the problem entails encoding data via topological modifications of the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone. The DNA Punchcards system, which introduces nicks (cuts) in the DNA backbone, encodes only one bit per nicking site, limiting density. We propose \emph{DNA Tails,} a storage paradigm that encodes nonbinary symbols at nicking sites by growing enzymatically synthesized single-stranded DNA of varied lengths. The average tail lengths encode multiple information bits and are controlled via a staggered nicking-tail extension process. We demonstrate the feasibility of this encoding approach experimentally and identify common sources of errors, such as calibration errors and stumped tail growth errors. To mitigate calibration errors, we use rank modulation proposed for flash memory. To correct stumped tail growth errors, we introduce a new family of rank modulation codes that can correct ``stuck-at'' errors. Our analytical results include constructions for order-optimal-redundancy permutation codes and accompanying encoding and decoding algorithms.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03629.pdf,"Jin Sima, Chao Pan, S.

Breaking Annotation Barriers: Generalized Video Quality Assessment via Ranking-based Self-Supervision,"Video quality assessment (VQA) is essential for quantifying perceptual quality in various video processing workflows, spanning from camera capture systems to over-the-top streaming platforms. While recent supervised VQA models have made substantial progress, the reliance on manually annotated datasets -- a process that is labor-intensive, costly, and difficult to scale up -- has hindered further optimization of their generalization to unseen video content and distortions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a self-supervised learning framework for VQA to learn quality assessment capabilities from large-scale, unlabeled web videos. Our approach leverages a \textbf{learning-to-rank} paradigm to train a large multimodal model (LMM) on video pairs automatically labeled via two manners, including quality pseudo-labeling by existing VQA models and relative quality ranking based on synthetic distortion simulations. Furthermore, we introduce a novel \textbf{iterative self-improvement training strategy}, where the trained model acts an improved annotator to iteratively refine the annotation quality of training data. By training on a dataset $10\times$ larger than the existing VQA benchmarks, our model: (1) achieves zero-shot performance on in-domain VQA benchmarks that matches or surpasses supervised models; (2) demonstrates superior out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization across diverse video content and distortions; and (3) sets a new state-of-the-art when fine-tuned on human-labeled datasets. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our self-supervised approach in training generalized VQA models. The datasets and code will be publicly released to facilitate future research.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03631.pdf,"Linhan Cao, Wei Sun, Kaiwei Zhang, Yicong Peng, Guangtao Zhai, Xiongkuo Min",cs.CV
Towards Smart Point-and-Shoot Photography,"Hundreds of millions of people routinely take photos using their smartphones as point and shoot (PAS) cameras, yet very few would have the photography skills to compose a good shot of a scene. While traditional PAS cameras have built-in functions to ensure a photo is well focused and has the right brightness, they cannot tell the users how to compose the best shot of a scene. In this paper, we present a first of its kind smart point and shoot (SPAS) system to help users to take good photos. Our SPAS proposes to help users to compose a good shot of a scene by automatically guiding the users to adjust the camera pose live on the scene. We first constructed a large dataset containing 320K images with camera pose information from 4000 scenes. We then developed an innovative CLIP-based Composition Quality Assessment (CCQA) model to assign pseudo labels to these images. The CCQA introduces a unique learnable text embedding technique to learn continuous word embeddings capable of discerning subtle visual quality differences in the range covered by five levels of quality description words {bad, poor, fair, good, perfect}. And finally we have developed a camera pose adjustment model (CPAM) which first determines if the current view can be further improved and if so it outputs the adjust suggestion in the form of two camera pose adjustment angles. The two tasks of CPAM make decisions in a sequential manner and each involves different sets of training samples, we have developed a mixture-of-experts model with a gated loss function to train the CPAM in an end-to-end manner. We will present extensive results to demonstrate the performances of our SPAS system using publicly available image composition datasets.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03638.pdf,"Jiawan Li, Fei Zhou, Zhipeng Zhong, Jiongzhi Lin, Guoping Qiu",cs.CV
Differential Privacy for Network Assortativity,"The analysis of network assortativity is of great importance for understanding the structural characteristics of and dynamics upon networks. Often, network assortativity is quantified using the assortativity coefficient that is defined based on the Pearson correlation coefficient between vertex degrees. It is well known that a network may contain sensitive information, such as the number of friends of an individual in a social network (which is abstracted as the degree of vertex.). So, the computation of the assortativity coefficient leads to privacy leakage, which increases the urgent need for privacy-preserving protocol. However, there has been no scheme addressing the concern above.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03639.pdf,"Fei Ma, Jinzhi Ouyang, Xincheng Hu",cs.CR
Synthesizing Images on Perceptual Boundaries of ANNs for Uncovering and Manipulating Human Perceptual Variability,"Human decision-making in cognitive tasks and daily life exhibits considerable variability, shaped by factors such as task difficulty, individual preferences, and personal experiences. Understanding this variability across individuals is essential for uncovering the perceptual and decision-making mechanisms that humans rely on when faced with uncertainty and ambiguity. We present a computational framework BAM (Boundary Alignment & Manipulation framework) that combines perceptual boundary sampling in ANNs and human behavioral experiments to systematically investigate this phenomenon. Our perceptual boundary sampling algorithm generates stimuli along ANN decision boundaries that intrinsically induce significant perceptual variability. The efficacy of these stimuli is empirically validated through large-scale behavioral experiments involving 246 participants across 116,715 trials, culminating in the variMNIST dataset containing 19,943 systematically annotated images. Through personalized model alignment and adversarial generation, we establish a reliable method for simultaneously predicting and manipulating the divergent perceptual decisions of pairs of participants. This work bridges the gap between computational models and human individual difference research, providing new tools for personalized perception analysis.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03641.pdf,"Chen Wei, Chi Zhang, Jiachen Zou, Haotian Deng, Dietmar Heinke, Quanying Liu",cs.AI
BURNS: Backward Underapproximate Reachability for Neural-Feedback-Loop Systems,"Learning-enabled planning and control algorithms are increasingly popular, but they often lack rigorous guarantees of performance or safety. We introduce an algorithm for computing underapproximate backward reachable sets of nonlinear discrete time neural feedback loops. We then use the backward reachable sets to check goal-reaching properties. Our algorithm is based on overapproximating the system dynamics function to enable computation of underapproximate backward reachable sets through solutions of mixed-integer linear programs. We rigorously analyze the soundness of our algorithm and demonstrate it on a numerical example. Our work expands the class of properties that can be verified for learning-enabled systems.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03643.pdf,"Chelsea Sidrane, Jana Tumova",cs.AI
ALMA: Aggregated Lipschitz Maximization Attack on Auto-encoders,"Despite the extensive use of deep autoencoders (AEs) in critical applications, their adversarial robustness remains relatively underexplored compared to classification models. AE robustness is characterized by the Lipschitz bounds of its components. Existing robustness evaluation frameworks based on white-box attacks do not fully exploit the vulnerabilities of intermediate ill-conditioned layers in AEs. In the context of optimizing imperceptible norm-bounded additive perturbations to maximize output damage, existing methods struggle to effectively propagate adversarial loss gradients throughout the network, often converging to less effective perturbations. To address this, we propose a novel layer-conditioning-based adversarial optimization objective that effectively guides the adversarial map toward regions of local Lipschitz bounds by enhancing loss gradient information propagation during attack optimization. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on state-of-the-art AEs that our adversarial objective results in stronger attacks, outperforming existing methods in both universal and sample-specific scenarios. As a defense method against this attack, we introduce an inference-time adversarially trained defense plugin that mitigates the effects of adversarial examples.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03646.pdf,"Chethan Krishnamurthy Ramanaik, Arjun Roy, Eirini Ntoutsi",cs.LG
Optimal Droop Control Strategy for Coordinated Voltage Regulation and Power Sharing in Hybrid AC-MTDC Systems,"With the growing integration of modular multilevel converters (MMCs) in Multi-Terminal Direct Current (MTDC) transmission systems, there is an increasing need for control strategies that ensure both economic efficiency and robust dynamic performance. This paper presents an enhanced Optimal Power Flow (OPF) framework for hybrid AC-MTDC systems, integrating a novel droop control strategy that coordinates DC voltage and AC frequency regulation. By embedding frequency control loops into the MMCs, the method enables system-wide coordination, enhancing power sharing and improving system resilience under disturbances. The proposed strategy dynamically adjusts converter operating points to minimize generation costs and DC voltage deviations, thus balancing economic objectives with system stability. A modified Nordic test system integrated with a four-terminal MTDC grid is used to validate the approach. Optimization is performed using Julia, while the system's dynamic performance is evaluated through electromagnetic transient simulations with the EMTP software. Case studies across multiple scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves lower generation costs than active power control and adaptive droop control strategy while maintaining stable control characteristics. The results highlight the method's capability to deliver cost-effective operation without compromising performance, offering a promising solution for the coordinated control of future hybrid AC-DC transmission networks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03651.pdf,"Hongjin Du, Tuanku Badzlin Hashfi, Rashmi Prasad, Pedro P.

Mitigating mode collapse in normalizing flows by annealing with an adaptive schedule: Application to parameter estimation,"Normalizing flows (NFs) provide uncorrelated samples from complex distributions, making them an appealing tool for parameter estimation. However, the practical utility of NFs remains limited by their tendency to collapse to a single mode of a multimodal distribution. In this study, we show that annealing with an adaptive schedule based on the effective sample size (ESS) can mitigate mode collapse. We demonstrate that our approach can converge the marginal likelihood for a biochemical oscillator model fit to time-series data in ten-fold less computation time than a widely used ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We show that the ESS can also be used to reduce variance by pruning the samples. We expect these developments to be of general use for sampling with NFs and discuss potential opportunities for further improvements.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03652.pdf,"Yihang Wang, Chris Chi, Aaron R.

ReGraP-LLaVA: Reasoning enabled Graph-based Personalized Large Language and Vision Assistant,"Recent advances in personalized MLLMs enable effective capture of user-specific concepts, supporting both recognition of personalized concepts and contextual captioning. However, humans typically explore and reason over relations among objects and individuals, transcending surface-level information to achieve more personalized and contextual understanding. To this end, existing methods may face three main limitations: Their training data lacks multi-object sets in which relations among objects are learnable. Building on the limited training data, their models overlook the relations between different personalized concepts and fail to reason over them. Their experiments mainly focus on a single personalized concept, where evaluations are limited to recognition and captioning tasks. To address the limitations, we present a new dataset named ReGraP, consisting of 120 sets of personalized knowledge. Each set includes images, KGs, and CoT QA pairs derived from the KGs, enabling more structured and sophisticated reasoning pathways. We propose ReGraP-LLaVA, an MLLM trained with the corresponding KGs and CoT QA pairs, where soft and hard graph prompting methods are designed to align KGs within the model's semantic space. We establish the ReGraP Benchmark, which contains diverse task types: multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, True/False, and descriptive questions in both open- and closed-ended settings. The proposed benchmark is designed to evaluate the relational reasoning and knowledge-connection capability of personalized MLLMs. We conduct experiments on the proposed ReGraP-LLaVA and other competitive MLLMs. Results show that the proposed model not only learns personalized knowledge but also performs relational reasoning in responses, achieving the SoTA performance compared with the competitive methods.

Counterfactual Inference for Eliminating Sentiment Bias in Recommender Systems,"Recommender Systems (RSs) aim to provide personalized recommendations for users. A newly discovered bias, known as sentiment bias, uncovers a common phenomenon within Review-based RSs (RRSs): the recommendation accuracy of users or items with negative reviews deteriorates compared with users or items with positive reviews. Critical users and niche items are disadvantaged by such unfair recommendations. We study this problem from the perspective of counterfactual inference with two stages. At the model training stage, we build a causal graph and model how sentiment influences the final rating score. During the inference stage, we decouple the direct and indirect effects to mitigate the impact of sentiment bias and remove the indirect effect using counterfactual inference. We have conducted extensive experiments, and the results validate that our model can achieve comparable performance on rating prediction for better recommendations and effective mitigation of sentiment bias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ counterfactual inference on sentiment bias mitigation in RSs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03655.pdf,"Le Pan, Yuanjiang Cao, Chengkai Huang, Wenjie Zhang, Lina Yao",cs.IR
Revolutionizing Brain Tumor Imaging: Generating Synthetic 3D FA Maps from T1-Weighted MRI using CycleGAN Models,"Fractional anisotropy (FA) and directionally encoded colour (DEC) maps are essential for evaluating white matter integrity and structural connectivity in neuroimaging. However, the spatial misalignment between FA maps and tractography atlases hinders their effective integration into predictive models. To address this issue, we propose a CycleGAN based approach for generating FA maps directly from T1-weighted MRI scans, representing the first application of this technique to both healthy and tumour-affected tissues. Our model, trained on unpaired data, produces high fidelity maps, which have been rigorously evaluated using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), demonstrating particularly robust performance in tumour regions. Radiological assessments further underscore the model's potential to enhance clinical workflows by providing an AI-driven alternative that reduces the necessity for additional scans.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03662.pdf,"Xin Du, Francesca M.

Distribution-Conditional Generation: From Class Distribution to Creative Generation,"Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models are effective at producing semantically aligned images, but their reliance on training data distributions limits their ability to synthesize truly novel, out-of-distribution concepts. Existing methods typically enhance creativity by combining pairs of known concepts, yielding compositions that, while out-of-distribution, remain linguistically describable and bounded within the existing semantic space. Inspired by the soft probabilistic outputs of classifiers on ambiguous inputs, we propose Distribution-Conditional Generation, a novel formulation that models creativity as image synthesis conditioned on class distributions, enabling semantically unconstrained creative generation. Building on this, we propose DisTok, an encoder-decoder framework that maps class distributions into a latent space and decodes them into tokens of creative concept. DisTok maintains a dynamic concept pool and iteratively sampling and fusing concept pairs, enabling the generation of tokens aligned with increasingly complex class distributions. To enforce distributional consistency, latent vectors sampled from a Gaussian prior are decoded into tokens and rendered into images, whose class distributions-predicted by a vision-language model-supervise the alignment between input distributions and the visual semantics of generated tokens. The resulting tokens are added to the concept pool for subsequent composition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DisTok, by unifying distribution-conditioned fusion and sampling-based synthesis, enables efficient and flexible token-level generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with superior text-image alignment and human preference scores.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03667.pdf,"Fu Feng, Yucheng Xie, Xu Yang, Jing Wang, Xin Geng",cs.CV
Learning Symbolic Persistent Macro-Actions for POMDP Solving Over Time,"This paper proposes an integration of temporal logical reasoning and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to achieve interpretable decision-making under uncertainty with macro-actions. Our method leverages a fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) based on Event Calculus (EC) to generate \emph{persistent} (i.e., constant) macro-actions, which guide Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based POMDP solvers over a time horizon, significantly reducing inference time while ensuring robust performance. Such macro-actions are learnt via Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) from a few traces of execution (belief-action pairs), thus eliminating the need for manually designed heuristics and requiring only the specification of the POMDP transition model. In the Pocman and Rocksample benchmark scenarios, our learned macro-actions demonstrate increased expressiveness and generality when compared to time-independent heuristics, indeed offering substantial computational efficiency improvements.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03668.pdf,"Celeste Veronese, Daniele Meli, Alessandro Farinelli",cs.AI
RoboOS: A Hierarchical Embodied Framework for Cross-Embodiment and Multi-Agent Collaboration,"The dawn of embodied intelligence has ushered in an unprecedented imperative for resilient, cognition-enabled multi-agent collaboration across next-generation ecosystems, revolutionizing paradigms in autonomous manufacturing, adaptive service robotics, and cyber-physical production architectures. However, current robotic systems face significant limitations, such as limited cross-embodiment adaptability, inefficient task scheduling, and insufficient dynamic error correction. While End-to-end VLA models demonstrate inadequate long-horizon planning and task generalization, hierarchical VLA models suffer from a lack of cross-embodiment and multi-agent coordination capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce RoboOS, the first open-source embodied system built on a Brain-Cerebellum hierarchical architecture, enabling a paradigm shift from single-agent to multi-agent intelligence. Specifically, RoboOS consists of three key components: (1) Embodied Brain Model (RoboBrain), a MLLM designed for global perception and high-level decision-making; (2) Cerebellum Skill Library, a modular, plug-and-play toolkit that facilitates seamless execution of multiple skills; and (3) Real-Time Shared Memory, a spatiotemporal synchronization mechanism for coordinating multi-agent states. By integrating hierarchical information flow, RoboOS bridges Embodied Brain and Cerebellum Skill Library, facilitating robust planning, scheduling, and error correction for long-horizon tasks, while ensuring efficient multi-agent collaboration through Real-Time Shared Memory. Furthermore, we enhance edge-cloud communication and cloud-based distributed inference to facilitate high-frequency interactions and enable scalable deployment. Extensive real-world experiments across various scenarios, demonstrate RoboOS's versatility in supporting heterogeneous embodiments.

"Gap the (Theory of) Mind: Sharing Beliefs About Teammates' Goals Boosts Collaboration Perception, Not Performance","In human-agent teams, openly sharing goals is often assumed to enhance planning, collaboration, and effectiveness. However, direct communication of these goals is not always feasible, requiring teammates to infer their partner's intentions through actions. Building on this, we investigate whether an AI agent's ability to share its inferred understanding of a human teammate's goals can improve task performance and perceived collaboration. Through an experiment comparing three conditions-no recognition (NR), viable goals (VG), and viable goals on-demand (VGod) - we find that while goal-sharing information did not yield significant improvements in task performance or overall satisfaction scores, thematic analysis suggests that it supported strategic adaptations and subjective perceptions of collaboration. Cognitive load assessments revealed no additional burden across conditions, highlighting the challenge of balancing informativeness and simplicity in human-agent interactions. These findings highlight the nuanced trade-off of goal-sharing: while it fosters trust and enhances perceived collaboration, it can occasionally hinder objective performance gains.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03674.pdf,"Yotam Amitai, Reuth Mirsky, Ofra Amir",cs.AI
Towards conversational assistants for health applications: using ChatGPT to generate conversations about heart failure,"We explore the potential of ChatGPT (3.5-turbo and 4) to generate conversations focused on self-care strategies for African-American heart failure patients -- a domain with limited specialized datasets. To simulate patient-health educator dialogues, we employed four prompting strategies: domain, African American Vernacular English (AAVE), Social Determinants of Health (SDOH), and SDOH-informed reasoning. Conversations were generated across key self-care domains of food, exercise, and fluid intake, with varying turn lengths (5, 10, 15) and incorporated patient-specific SDOH attributes such as age, gender, neighborhood, and socioeconomic status. Our findings show that effective prompt design is essential.

Rational Retrieval Acts: Leveraging Pragmatic Reasoning to Improve Sparse Retrieval,"Current sparse neural information retrieval (IR) methods, and to a lesser extent more traditional models such as BM25, do not take into account the document collection and the complex interplay between different term weights when representing a single document. In this paper, we show how the Rational Speech Acts (RSA), a linguistics framework used to minimize the number of features to be communicated when identifying an object in a set, can be adapted to the IR case -- and in particular to the high number of potential features (here, tokens). RSA dynamically modulates token-document interactions by considering the influence of other documents in the dataset, better contrasting document representations. Experiments show that incorporating RSA consistently improves multiple sparse retrieval models and achieves state-of-the-art performance on out-of-domain datasets from the BEIR benchmark. https://github.com/arthur-75/Rational-Retrieval-Acts",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03676.pdf,"Arthur Satouf, Gabriel Ben Zenou, Benjamin Piwowarski, Habiboulaye Amadou Boubacar, Pablo Piantanida",cs.IR

We investigate how the model's performance is affected by the chosen layout paradigm, the aesthetics of the drawing, and the prompting technique used for the queries. We formulate three corresponding research questions and present the results of a thorough experimental analysis. Our findings reveal that choosing the right layout paradigm and optimizing the readability of the input drawing from a human perspective can significantly improve the performance of the model on the given task. Moreover, selecting the most effective prompting technique is a challenging yet crucial task for achieving optimal performance.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03678.pdf,"Walter Didimo, Fabrizio Montecchiani, Tommaso Piselli",cs.AI
CaRaFFusion: Improving 2D Semantic Segmentation with Camera-Radar Point Cloud Fusion and Zero-Shot Image Inpainting,"Segmenting objects in an environment is a crucial task for autonomous driving and robotics, as it enables a better understanding of the surroundings of each agent. Although camera sensors provide rich visual details, they are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions. In contrast, radar sensors remain robust under such conditions, but often produce sparse and noisy data. Therefore, a promising approach is to fuse information from both sensors. In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance camera-only baselines by integrating a diffusion model into a camera-radar fusion architecture. We leverage radar point features to create pseudo-masks using the Segment-Anything model, treating the projected radar points as point prompts. Additionally, we propose a noise reduction unit to denoise these pseudo-masks, which are further used to generate inpainted images that complete the missing information in the original images. Our method improves the camera-only segmentation baseline by 2.63% in mIoU and enhances our camera-radar fusion architecture by 1.48% in mIoU on the Waterscenes dataset. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach for semantic segmentation using camera-radar fusion under adverse weather conditions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03679.pdf,"Huawei Sun, Bora Kunter Sahin, Georg Stettinger, Maximilian Bernhard, Matthias Schubert, Robert Wille",cs.CV
Location-Restricted Stable Matching,"Motivated by group-project distribution, we introduce and study stable matching under the constraint of applicants needing to share a location to be matched with the same institute, which we call the Location-Restricted Stable Matching problem (LRSM). We show that finding a feasible matching is NP-hard, making finding a feasible and stable matching automatically NP-hard. We then analyze the subproblem where all the projects have the same capacity, and the applicant population of each location is a multiple of the universal project capacity, which mimics more realistic constraints and makes finding a feasible matching in P. Even under these conditions, a stable matching (a matching without blocking pairs) may not exist, so we look for a matching that minimizes the number of blocking pairs. We find that the blocking pair minimization problem for this subproblem is inapproximable within $|A|^{1-\epsilon}$ for $|A|$ agents and provide an $|A|$-approximation algorithm to show this result is almost tight. We extend this result to show that the problem of minimizing the number of agents in blocking pairs is also inapproximable within $|A|^{1-\epsilon}$, and since there are only $|A|$ agents, this result is also almost tight.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03680.pdf,Garret Castro,cs.DS
Evaluating Foveated Frame Rate Reduction in Virtual Reality for Head-Mounted Displays,"Foveated rendering methods usually reduce spatial resolution in the periphery of the users' view. However, using foveated rendering to reduce temporal resolution, i.e., rendering frame rate, seems less explored. In this work, we present the results of a user study investigating the perceptual effects of foveated temporal resolution reduction, where only the temporal resolution (frame rate) is reduced in the periphery without affecting spatial quality (pixel density). In particular, we investigated the perception of temporal resolution artifacts caused by reducing the frame rate dependent on the eccentricity of the user's gaze. Our user study with 15 participants was conducted in a virtual reality setting using a head-mounted display. Our results indicate that it was possible to reduce average rendering costs, i.e., the number of rendered pixels, to a large degree before participants consistently reported perceiving temporal artifacts.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03682.pdf,"Christopher Fl\""oter, Sergej Geringer, Guido Reina, Daniel Weiskopf, Timo Ropinski",cs.HC
Moral Testing of Autonomous Driving Systems,"Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing plays a crucial role in their development, with the current focus primarily on functional and safety testing. However, evaluating the non-functional morality of ADSs, particularly their decision-making capabilities in unavoidable collision scenarios, is equally important to ensure the systems' trustworthiness and public acceptance. Unfortunately, testing ADS morality is nearly impossible due to the absence of universal moral principles. To address this challenge, this paper first extracts a set of moral meta-principles derived from existing moral experiments and well-established social science theories, aiming to capture widely recognized and common-sense moral values for ADSs. These meta-principles are then formalized as quantitative moral metamorphic relations, which act as the test oracle. Furthermore, we propose a metamorphic testing framework to systematically identify potential moral issues. Finally, we illustrate the implementation of the framework and present typical violation cases using the VIRES VTD simulator and its built-in ADS.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03683.pdf,"Wenbing Tang, Mingfei Cheng, Yuan Zhou, Yang Liu",cs.SE

In this paper, we present IndicSQuAD, a comprehensive multi-lingual extractive QA dataset covering nine major Indic languages, systematically derived from the SQuAD dataset. Building on previous work with MahaSQuAD for Marathi, our approach adapts and extends translation techniques to maintain high linguistic fidelity and accurate answer-span alignment across diverse languages.

This paper concentrates on pose graph construction and motion synchronization within multiview registration. Previous methods for pose graph construction often pruned fully connected graphs or constructed sparse graph using global feature aggregated from local descriptors, which may not consistently yield reliable results. To identify dependable pairs for pose graph construction, we design a network model that extracts information from the matching distance between point cloud pairs. For motion synchronization, we propose another neural network model to calculate the absolute pose in a data-driven manner, rather than optimizing inaccurate handcrafted loss functions. Our model takes into account geometric distribution information and employs a modified attention mechanism to facilitate flexible and reliable feature interaction. Experimental results on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

A Sequent Calculus For Trace Formula Implication,"Specification languages are essential in deductive program verification, but they are usually based on first-order logic, hence less expressive than the programs they specify. Recently, trace specification logics with fixed points that are at least as expressive as their target programs were proposed. This makes it possible to specify not merely pre- and postconditions, but the whole trace of even recursive programs. Previous work established a sound and complete calculus to determine whether a program satisfies a given trace formula. However, the applicability of the calculus and prospects for mechanized verification rely on the ability to prove consequence between trace formulas. We present a sound sequent calculus for proving implication (i.e. trace inclusion) between trace formulas. To handle fixed point operations with an unknown recursive bound, fixed point induction rules are used. We also employ contracts and {\mu}-formula synchronization. While this does not yet result in a complete calculus for trace formula implication, it is possible to prove many non-trivial properties.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03693.pdf,"Niklas Heidler, Reiner H\""ahnle",cs.LO
Demonstrating ViSafe: Vision-enabled Safety for High-speed Detect and Avoid,"Assured safe-separation is essential for achieving seamless high-density operation of airborne vehicles in a shared airspace. To equip resource-constrained aerial systems with this safety-critical capability, we present ViSafe, a high-speed vision-only airborne collision avoidance system. ViSafe offers a full-stack solution to the Detect and Avoid (DAA) problem by tightly integrating a learning-based edge-AI framework with a custom multi-camera hardware prototype designed under SWaP-C constraints. By leveraging perceptual input-focused control barrier functions (CBF) to design, encode, and enforce safety thresholds, ViSafe can provide provably safe runtime guarantees for self-separation in high-speed aerial operations. We evaluate ViSafe's performance through an extensive test campaign involving both simulated digital twins and real-world flight scenarios. By independently varying agent types, closure rates, interaction geometries, and environmental conditions (e.g., weather and lighting), we demonstrate that ViSafe consistently ensures self-separation across diverse scenarios. In first-of-its-kind real-world high-speed collision avoidance tests with closure rates reaching 144 km/h, ViSafe sets a new benchmark for vision-only autonomous collision avoidance, establishing a new standard for safety in high-speed aerial navigation.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03694.pdf,"Parv Kapoor, Ian Higgins, Nikhil Keetha, Jay Patrikar, Brady Moon, Zelin Ye, Yao He, Ivan Cisneros, Yaoyu Hu, Changliu Liu, Eunsuk Kang, Sebastian Scherer",cs.RO
Frenet Corridor Planner: An Optimal Local Path Planning Framework for Autonomous Driving,"Motivated by the requirements for effectiveness and efficiency, path-speed decomposition-based trajectory planning methods have widely been adopted for autonomous driving applications. While a global route can be pre-computed offline, real-time generation of adaptive local paths remains crucial. Therefore, we present the Frenet Corridor Planner (FCP), an optimization-based local path planning strategy for autonomous driving that ensures smooth and safe navigation around obstacles. Modeling the vehicles as safety-augmented bounding boxes and pedestrians as convex hulls in the Frenet space, our approach defines a drivable corridor by determining the appropriate deviation side for static obstacles. Thereafter, a modified space-domain bicycle kinematics model enables path optimization for smoothness, boundary clearance, and dynamic obstacle risk minimization. The optimized path is then passed to a speed planner to generate the final trajectory. We validate FCP through extensive simulations and real-world hardware experiments, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03695.pdf,"Faizan M.

Self-Supervised Learning for Robotic Leaf Manipulation: A Hybrid Geometric-Neural Approach,"Automating leaf manipulation in agricultural settings faces significant challenges, including the variability of plant morphologies and deformable leaves. We propose a novel hybrid geometric-neural approach for autonomous leaf grasping that combines traditional computer vision with neural networks through self-supervised learning. Our method integrates YOLOv8 for instance segmentation and RAFT-Stereo for 3D depth estimation to build rich leaf representations, which feed into both a geometric feature scoring pipeline and a neural refinement module (GraspPointCNN). The key innovation is our confidence-weighted fusion mechanism that dynamically balances the contribution of each approach based on prediction certainty. Our self-supervised framework uses the geometric pipeline as an expert teacher to automatically generate training data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves an 88.0% success rate in controlled environments and 84.7% in real greenhouse conditions, significantly outperforming both purely geometric (75.3%) and neural (60.2%) methods. This work establishes a new paradigm for agricultural robotics where domain expertise is seamlessly integrated with machine learning capabilities, providing a foundation for fully automated crop monitoring systems.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03702.pdf,"Srecharan Selvam, Abhishesh Silwal, George Kanter",cs.RO
Fill the Gap: Quantifying and Reducing the Modality Gap in Image-Text Representation Learning,"Vision-language models (VLMs) allow to embed texts and images in a shared representation space. However, it has been shown that these models are subject to a modality gap phenomenon meaning there exists a clear separation between the embeddings from one modality and another in the embedding space. While this misalignment is detrimental for downstream tasks such as multimodal retrieval, multimodal clustering or zero-shot classification, etc. no generic and practical methods have so far been proposed to assess it precisely and even reduce it. We therefore propose novel measures and effective techniques (spectral- and optimal transport-based methods) to achieve this goal. Extensive experiments conducted on several image-text datasets and models demonstrate their effectiveness and beneficial effects on downstream tasks.

Toward a Harmonized Approach -- Requirement-based Structuring of a Safety Assurance Argumentation for Automated Vehicles,"Despite increasing testing operation on public roads, media reports on incidents show that safety issues remain to this day. One major cause factoring into this circumstance is high development uncertainty that manufacturers face when deploying these systems in an open context. In particular, one challenge is establishing a valid argument at design time that the vehicle will exhibit reasonable residual risk when operating in its intended operational design domain. Regulations, such as the European Implementing Regulation 2022/1426, require manufacturers to provide a safety assurance argumentation for SAE-Level-4 automated vehicles. While there is extensive literature on assurance cases for safety-critical systems, the domain of automated driving lacks explicit requirements regarding the creation of safety assurance argumentations. In this paper, we aim to narrow this gap by elaborating a requirement-based approach. We derive structural requirements for an argumentation from literature and supplement these with requirements derived from stakeholder concerns. We implement the requirements, yielding a proposal for an overall argumentation structure. The resulting ""safety arguments"" argue over four topic complexes: The developed product, the underlying process including its conformance/compliance to standards/laws, as well as the argumentations' context and soundness. Finally, we instantiate this structure with respect to domain-specific needs and principles.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03709.pdf,"M. Loba, N. F. Salem, M. Nolte, A. Dotzler, M. Maurer",eess.SY
NBF at SemEval-2025 Task 5: Light-Burst Attention Enhanced System for Multilingual Subject Recommendation,"We present our system submission for SemEval 2025 Task 5, which focuses on cross-lingual subject classification in the English and German academic domains. Our approach leverages bilingual data during training, employing negative sampling and a margin-based retrieval objective. We demonstrate that a dimension-as-token self-attention mechanism designed with significantly reduced internal dimensions can effectively encode sentence embeddings for subject retrieval. In quantitative evaluation, our system achieved an average recall rate of 32.24% in the general quantitative setting (all subjects), 43.16% and 31.53% of the general qualitative evaluation methods with minimal GPU usage, highlighting their competitive performance. Our results demonstrate that our approach is effective in capturing relevant subject information under resource constraints, although there is still room for improvement.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03711.pdf,"Baharul Islam, Nasim Ahmad, Ferdous Ahmed Barbhuiya, Kuntal Dey",cs.CL
Learning Survival Distributions with the Asymmetric Laplace Distribution,"Probabilistic survival analysis models seek to estimate the distribution of the future occurrence (time) of an event given a set of covariates. In recent years, these models have preferred nonparametric specifications that avoid directly estimating survival distributions via discretization. Specifically, they estimate the probability of an individual event at fixed times or the time of an event at fixed probabilities (quantiles), using supervised learning. Borrowing ideas from the quantile regression literature, we propose a parametric survival analysis method based on the Asymmetric Laplace Distribution (ALD). This distribution allows for closed-form calculation of popular event summaries such as mean, median, mode, variation, and quantiles. The model is optimized by maximum likelihood to learn, at the individual level, the parameters (location, scale, and asymmetry) of the ALD distribution. Extensive results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms parametric and nonparametric approaches in terms of accuracy, discrimination and calibration.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03712.pdf,"Deming Sheng, Ricardo Henao",cs.LG
DISARM++: Beyond scanner-free harmonization,"Harmonization of T1-weighted MR images across different scanners is crucial for ensuring consistency in neuroimaging studies. This study introduces a novel approach to direct image harmonization, moving beyond feature standardization to ensure that extracted features remain inherently reliable for downstream analysis. Our method enables image transfer in two ways: (1) mapping images to a scanner-free space for uniform appearance across all scanners, and (2) transforming images into the domain of a specific scanner used in model training, embedding its unique characteristics. Our approach presents strong generalization capability, even for unseen scanners not included in the training phase. We validated our method using MR images from diverse cohorts, including healthy controls, traveling subjects, and individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The model's effectiveness is tested in multiple applications, such as brain age prediction (R2 = 0.60 \pm 0.05), biomarker extraction, AD classification (Test Accuracy = 0.86 \pm 0.03), and diagnosis prediction (AUC = 0.95). In all cases, our harmonization technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing improvements in both reliability and predictive accuracy. Moreover, our approach eliminates the need for extensive preprocessing steps, such as skull-stripping, which can introduce errors by misclassifying brain and non-brain structures. This makes our method particularly suitable for applications that require full-head analysis, including research on head trauma and cranial deformities. Additionally, our harmonization model does not require retraining for new datasets, allowing smooth integration into various neuroimaging workflows. By ensuring scanner-invariant image quality, our approach provides a robust and efficient solution for improving neuroimaging studies across diverse settings. The code is available at this link.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03715.pdf,"Luca Caldera, Lara Cavinato, Alessio Cirone, Isabella Cama, Sara Garbarino, Raffaele Lodi, Fabrizio Tagliavini, Anna Nigri, Silvia De Francesco, Andrea Cappozzo, Michele Piana, Francesca Ieva",cs.CV
Sustainable Smart Farm Networks: Enhancing Resilience and Efficiency with Decision Theory-Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Solar sensor-based monitoring systems have become a crucial agricultural innovation, advancing farm management and animal welfare through integrating sensor technology, Internet-of-Things, and edge and cloud computing. However, the resilience of these systems to cyber-attacks and their adaptability to dynamic and constrained energy supplies remain largely unexplored. To address these challenges, we propose a sustainable smart farm network designed to maintain high-quality animal monitoring under various cyber and adversarial threats, as well as fluctuating energy conditions. Our approach utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to devise optimal policies that maximize both monitoring effectiveness and energy efficiency. To overcome DRL's inherent challenge of slow convergence, we integrate transfer learning (TL) and decision theory (DT) to accelerate the learning process. By incorporating DT-guided strategies, we optimize monitoring quality and energy sustainability, significantly reducing training time while achieving comparable performance rewards. Our experimental results prove that DT-guided DRL outperforms TL-enhanced DRL models, improving system performance and reducing training runtime by 47.5%.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03721.pdf,"Dian Chen, Zelin Wan, Dong Sam Ha, Jin-Hee Cho",cs.LG
Meta-Optimization and Program Search using Language Models for Task and Motion Planning,"Intelligent interaction with the real world requires robotic agents to jointly reason over high-level plans and low-level controls. Task and motion planning (TAMP) addresses this by combining symbolic planning and continuous trajectory generation. Recently, foundation model approaches to TAMP have presented impressive results, including fast planning times and the execution of natural language instructions. Yet, the optimal interface between high-level planning and low-level motion generation remains an open question: prior approaches are limited by either too much abstraction (e.g., chaining simplified skill primitives) or a lack thereof (e.g., direct joint angle prediction). Our method introduces a novel technique employing a form of meta-optimization to address these issues by: (i) using program search over trajectory optimization problems as an interface between a foundation model and robot control, and (ii) leveraging a zero-order method to optimize numerical parameters in the foundation model output. Results on challenging object manipulation and drawing tasks confirm that our proposed method improves over prior TAMP approaches.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03725.pdf,"Denis Shcherba, Eckart Cobo-Briesewitz, Cornelius V.

PyRoki: A Modular Toolkit for Robot Kinematic Optimization,"Robot motion can have many goals. Depending on the task, we might optimize for pose error, speed, collision, or similarity to a human demonstration. Motivated by this, we present PyRoki: a modular, extensible, and cross-platform toolkit for solving kinematic optimization problems. PyRoki couples an interface for specifying kinematic variables and costs with an efficient nonlinear least squares optimizer. Unlike existing tools, it is also cross-platform: optimization runs natively on CPU, GPU, and TPU. In this paper, we present (i) the design and implementation of PyRoki, (ii) motion retargeting and planning case studies that highlight the advantages of PyRoki's modularity, and (iii) optimization benchmarking, where PyRoki can be 1.4-1.7x faster and converges to lower errors than cuRobo, an existing GPU-accelerated inverse kinematics library.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03728.pdf,"Chung Min Kim, Brent Yi, Hongsuk Choi, Yi Ma, Ken Goldberg, Angjoo Kanazawa",cs.RO
Visual Imitation Enables Contextual Humanoid Control,"How can we teach humanoids to climb staircases and sit on chairs using the surrounding environment context? Arguably, the simplest way is to just show them-casually capture a human motion video and feed it to humanoids. We introduce VIDEOMIMIC, a real-to-sim-to-real pipeline that mines everyday videos, jointly reconstructs the humans and the environment, and produces whole-body control policies for humanoid robots that perform the corresponding skills. We demonstrate the results of our pipeline on real humanoid robots, showing robust, repeatable contextual control such as staircase ascents and descents, sitting and standing from chairs and benches, as well as other dynamic whole-body skills-all from a single policy, conditioned on the environment and global root commands. VIDEOMIMIC offers a scalable path towards teaching humanoids to operate in diverse real-world environments.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03729.pdf,"Arthur Allshire, Hongsuk Choi, Junyi Zhang, David McAllister, Anthony Zhang, Chung Min Kim, Trevor Darrell, Pieter Abbeel, Jitendra Malik, Angjoo Kanazawa",cs.RO
FlexiAct: Towards Flexible Action Control in Heterogeneous Scenarios,"Action customization involves generating videos where the subject performs actions dictated by input control signals. Current methods use pose-guided or global motion customization but are limited by strict constraints on spatial structure, such as layout, skeleton, and viewpoint consistency, reducing adaptability across diverse subjects and scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose FlexiAct, which transfers actions from a reference video to an arbitrary target image. Unlike existing methods, FlexiAct allows for variations in layout, viewpoint, and skeletal structure between the subject of the reference video and the target image, while maintaining identity consistency. Achieving this requires precise action control, spatial structure adaptation, and consistency preservation. To this end, we introduce RefAdapter, a lightweight image-conditioned adapter that excels in spatial adaptation and consistency preservation, surpassing existing methods in balancing appearance consistency and structural flexibility. Additionally, based on our observations, the denoising process exhibits varying levels of attention to motion (low frequency) and appearance details (high frequency) at different timesteps. So we propose FAE (Frequency-aware Action Extraction), which, unlike existing methods that rely on separate spatial-temporal architectures, directly achieves action extraction during the denoising process. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively transfers actions to subjects with diverse layouts, skeletons, and viewpoints. We release our code and model weights to support further research at https://shiyi-zh0408.github.io/projectpages/FlexiAct/",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03730.pdf,"Shiyi Zhang, Junhao Zhuang, Zhaoyang Zhang, Ying Shan, Yansong Tang",cs.CV
A Communication-First Account of Explanation,"This paper develops a formal account of causal explanation, grounded in a theory of conversational pragmatics, and inspired by the interventionist idea that explanation is about asking and answering what-if-things-had-been-different questions. We illustrate the fruitfulness of the account, relative to previous accounts, by showing that widely recognised explanatory virtues emerge naturally, as do subtle empirical patterns concerning the impact of norms on causal judgments. This shows the value of a communication-first approach to explanation: getting clear on explanation's communicative dimension is an important prerequisite for philosophical work on explanation. The result is a simple but powerful framework for incorporating insights from the cognitive sciences into philosophical work on explanation, which will be useful for philosophers or cognitive scientists interested in explanation.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03732.pdf,"Jacqueline Harding, Tobias Gerstenberg, Thomas Icard",cs.MA
WebGen-Bench: Evaluating LLMs on Generating Interactive and Functional Websites from Scratch,"LLM-based agents have demonstrated great potential in generating and managing code within complex codebases. In this paper, we introduce WebGen-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to measure an LLM-based agent's ability to create multi-file website codebases from scratch. It contains diverse instructions for website generation, created through the combined efforts of human annotators and GPT-4o. These instructions span three major categories and thirteen minor categories, encompassing nearly all important types of web applications. To assess the quality of the generated websites, we use GPT-4o to generate test cases targeting each functionality described in the instructions, and then manually filter, adjust, and organize them to ensure accuracy, resulting in 647 test cases. Each test case specifies an operation to be performed on the website and the expected result after the operation. To automate testing and improve reproducibility, we employ a powerful web-navigation agent to execute tests on the generated websites and determine whether the observed responses align with the expected results. We evaluate three high-performance code-agent frameworks, Bolt.diy, OpenHands, and Aider, using multiple proprietary and open-source LLMs as engines. The best-performing combination, Bolt.diy powered by DeepSeek-R1, achieves only 27.8\% accuracy on the test cases, highlighting the challenging nature of our benchmark. Additionally, we construct WebGen-Instruct, a training set consisting of 6,667 website-generation instructions. Training Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct on Bolt.diy trajectories generated from a subset of this training set achieves an accuracy of 38.2\%, surpassing the performance of the best proprietary model.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03733.pdf,"Zimu Lu, Yunqiao Yang, Houxing Ren, Haotian Hou, Han Xiao, Ke Wang, Weikang Shi, Aojun Zhou, Mingjie Zhan, Hongsheng Li",cs.CL
Multi-Agent System for Comprehensive Soccer Understanding,"Recent advancements in AI-driven soccer understanding have demonstrated rapid progress, yet existing research predominantly focuses on isolated or narrow tasks.

AMO: Adaptive Motion Optimization for Hyper-Dexterous Humanoid Whole-Body Control,"Humanoid robots derive much of their dexterity from hyper-dexterous whole-body movements, enabling tasks that require a large operational workspace: such as picking objects off the ground. However, achieving these capabilities on real humanoids remains challenging due to their high degrees of freedom (DoF) and nonlinear dynamics. We propose Adaptive Motion Optimization (AMO), a framework that integrates sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) with trajectory optimization for real-time, adaptive whole-body control. To mitigate distribution bias in motion imitation RL, we construct a hybrid AMO dataset and train a network capable of robust, on-demand adaptation to potentially O.O.D. commands. We validate AMO in simulation and on a 29-DoF Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrating superior stability and an expanded workspace compared to strong baselines. Finally, we show that AMO's consistent performance supports autonomous task execution via imitation learning, underscoring the system's versatility and robustness.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03738.pdf,"Jialong Li, Xuxin Cheng, Tianshu Huang, Shiqi Yang, Ri-Zhao Qiu, Xiaolong Wang",cs.RO
VITA-Audio: Fast Interleaved Cross-Modal Token Generation for Efficient Large Speech-Language Model,"With the growing requirement for natural human-computer interaction, speech-based systems receive increasing attention as speech is one of the most common forms of daily communication. However, the existing speech models still experience high latency when generating the first audio token during streaming, which poses a significant bottleneck for deployment. To address this issue, we propose VITA-Audio, an end-to-end large speech model with fast audio-text token generation. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Multiple Cross-modal Token Prediction (MCTP) module that efficiently generates multiple audio tokens within a single model forward pass, which not only accelerates the inference but also significantly reduces the latency for generating the first audio in streaming scenarios. In addition, a four-stage progressive training strategy is explored to achieve model acceleration with minimal loss of speech quality. To our knowledge, VITA-Audio is the first multi-modal large language model capable of generating audio output during the first forward pass, enabling real-time conversational capabilities with minimal latency. VITA-Audio is fully reproducible and is trained on open-source data only. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves an inference speedup of 3~5x at the 7B parameter scale, but also significantly outperforms open-source models of similar model size on multiple benchmarks for automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and spoken question answering (SQA) tasks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03739.pdf,"Zuwei Long, Yunhang Shen, Chaoyou Fu, Heting Gao, Lijiang Li, Peixian Chen, Mengdan Zhang, Hang Shao, Jian Li, Jinlong Peng, Haoyu Cao, Ke Li, Rongrong Ji, Xing Sun",cs.CL

Evaluation of Coordination Strategies for Underground Automated Vehicle Fleets in Mixed Traffic,"This study investigates the efficiency and safety outcomes of implementing different adaptive coordination models for automated vehicle (AV) fleets, managed by a centralized coordinator that dynamically responds to human-controlled vehicle behavior. The simulated scenarios replicate an underground mining environment characterized by narrow tunnels with limited connectivity. To address the unique challenges of such settings, we propose a novel metric - Path Overlap Density (POD) - to predict efficiency and potentially the safety performance of AV fleets. The study also explores the impact of map features on AV fleets performance. The results demonstrate that both AV fleet coordination strategies and underground tunnel network characteristics significantly influence overall system performance.

Physical foundations for trustworthy medical imaging: a review for artificial intelligence researchers,"Artificial intelligence in medical imaging has seen unprecedented growth in the last years, due to rapid advances in deep learning and computing resources. Applications cover the full range of existing medical imaging modalities, with unique characteristics driven by the physics of each technique. Yet, artificial intelligence professionals entering the field, and even experienced developers, often lack a comprehensive understanding of the physical principles underlying medical image acquisition, which hinders their ability to fully leverage its potential. The integration of physics knowledge into artificial intelligence algorithms enhances their trustworthiness and robustness in medical imaging, especially in scenarios with limited data availability. In this work, we review the fundamentals of physics in medical images and their impact on the latest advances in artificial intelligence, particularly, in generative models and reconstruction algorithms.

Floating Car Observers in Intelligent Transportation Systems: Detection Modeling and Temporal Insights,"Floating Car Observers (FCOs) extend traditional Floating Car Data (FCD) by integrating onboard sensors to detect and localize other traffic participants, providing richer and more detailed traffic data. In this work, we explore various modeling approaches for FCO detections within microscopic traffic simulations to evaluate their potential for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications. These approaches range from 2D raytracing to high-fidelity co-simulations that emulate real-world sensors and integrate 3D object detection algorithms to closely replicate FCO detections. Additionally, we introduce a neural network-based emulation technique that effectively approximates the results of high-fidelity co-simulations. This approach captures the unique characteristics of FCO detections while offering a fast and scalable solution for modeling. Using this emulation method, we investigate the impact of FCO data in a digital twin of a traffic network modeled in SUMO. Results demonstrate that even at a 20% penetration rate, FCOs using LiDAR-based detections can identify 65% of vehicles across various intersections and traffic demand scenarios. Further potential emerges when temporal insights are integrated, enabling the recovery of previously detected but currently unseen vehicles. By employing data-driven methods, we recover over 80% of these vehicles with minimal positional deviations. These findings underscore the potential of FCOs for ITS, particularly in enhancing traffic state estimation and monitoring under varying penetration rates and traffic conditions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02845.pdf,"Jeremias Gerner, Klaus Bogenberger, Stefanie Schmidtner",physics.soc-ph
Allocation of Heterogeneous Resources in General Lotto Games,"The allocation of resources plays an important role in the completion of system objectives and tasks, especially in the presence of strategic adversaries. Optimal allocation strategies are becoming increasingly more complex, given that multiple heterogeneous types of resources are at a system planner's disposal. In this paper, we focus on deriving optimal strategies for the allocation of heterogeneous resources in a well-known competitive resource allocation model known as the General Lotto game. In standard formulations, outcomes are determined solely by the players' allocation strategies of a common, single type of resource across multiple contests. In particular, a player wins a contest if it sends more resources than the opponent. Here, we propose a multi-resource extension where the winner of a contest is now determined not only by the amount of resources allocated, but also by the composition of resource types that are allocated. We completely characterize the equilibrium payoffs and strategies for two distinct formulations. The first consists of a weakest-link/best-shot winning rule, and the second considers a winning rule based on a weighted linear combination of the allocated resources. We then consider a scenario where the resource types are costly to purchase, and derive the players' equilibrium investments in each of the resource types.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02860.pdf,"Keith Paarporn, Adel Aghajan, Jason R.

"Taskmaster Deconstructed: A Quantitative Look at Tension, Volatility, and Viewer Ratings","Taskmaster is a British television show that combines comedic performance with a formal scoring system. Despite the appearance of structured competition, it remains unclear whether scoring dynamics contribute meaningfully to audience engagement. We conducted a statistical analysis of 162 episodes across 18 series, using fifteen episode-level metrics to quantify rank volatility, point spread, lead changes, and winner dominance. None of these metrics showed a significant association with IMDb ratings, even after controlling for series effects. Long-term trends suggest that average points have increased over time, while volatility has slightly declined and rank spread has remained stable. These patterns indicate an attempt to enhance competitive visibility without altering the show's structural equilibrium. We also analyzed contestant rank trajectories and identified five recurring archetypes describing performance styles. These patterns suggest that viewer interest is shaped more by contestant behavior than by game mechanics.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02886.pdf,David H. Silver,physics.soc-ph
CreoPep: A Universal Deep Learning Framework for Target-Specific Peptide Design and Optimization,"Target-specific peptides, such as conotoxins, exhibit exceptional binding affinity and selectivity toward ion channels and receptors. However, their therapeutic potential remains underutilized due to the limited diversity of natural variants and the labor-intensive nature of traditional optimization strategies. Here, we present CreoPep, a deep learning-based conditional generative framework that integrates masked language modeling with a progressive masking scheme to design high-affinity peptide mutants while uncovering novel structural motifs. CreoPep employs an integrative augmentation pipeline, combining FoldX-based energy screening with temperature-controlled multinomial sampling, to generate structurally and functionally diverse peptides that retain key pharmacological properties. We validate this approach by designing conotoxin inhibitors targeting the $\alpha$7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, achieving submicromolar potency in electrophysiological assays. Structural analysis reveals that CreoPep-generated variants engage in both conserved and novel binding modes, including disulfide-deficient forms, thus expanding beyond conventional design paradigms. Overall, CreoPep offers a robust and generalizable platform that bridges computational peptide design with experimental validation, accelerating the discovery of next-generation peptide therapeutics.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02887.pdf,"Cheng Ge, Han-Shen Tae, Zhenqiang Zhang, Lu Lu, Zhijie Huang, Yilin Wang, Tao Jiang, Wenqing Cai, Shan Chang, David J.

GeoERM: Geometry-Aware Multi-Task Representation Learning on Riemannian Manifolds,"Multi-Task Learning (MTL) seeks to boost statistical power and learning efficiency by discovering structure shared across related tasks. State-of-the-art MTL representation methods, however, usually treat the latent representation matrix as a point in ordinary Euclidean space, ignoring its often non-Euclidean geometry, thus sacrificing robustness when tasks are heterogeneous or even adversarial. We propose GeoERM, a geometry-aware MTL framework that embeds the shared representation on its natural Riemannian manifold and optimizes it via explicit manifold operations. Each training cycle performs (i) a Riemannian gradient step that respects the intrinsic curvature of the search space, followed by (ii) an efficient polar retraction to remain on the manifold, guaranteeing geometric fidelity at every iteration. The procedure applies to a broad class of matrix-factorized MTL models and retains the same per-iteration cost as Euclidean baselines. Across a set of synthetic experiments with task heterogeneity and on a wearable-sensor activity-recognition benchmark, GeoERM consistently improves estimation accuracy, reduces negative transfer, and remains stable under adversarial label noise, outperforming leading MTL and single-task alternatives.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02972.pdf,"Aoran Chen, Yang Feng",stat.ML
Parameter estimation for land-surface models using machine learning libraries,"The Neural Networks for Partial Differential Equations (NN4PDEs) approach is used to determine the parameters of a simple land-surface model using PyTorch's backpropagation engine. In order to test the inverse model, a synthetic dataset is created by running the model in forward mode with known parameter values to create soil temperature time series that can be used as observations for the inverse model. We show that it is not possible to obtain a reliable parameter estimation using a single observed soil temperature time series. Using measurements at two depths, reliable parameter estimates can be obtained although it is not possible to differentiate between latent and sensible heat fluxes. We apply the inverse model to urban flux tower data in Phoenix, United States, and show that the thermal conductivity, volumetric heat capacity, and the combined sensible-latent heat transfer coefficient can be reliably estimated using an observed value for the effective surface albedo. The resulting model accurately predicts the outgoing longwave radiation, conductive soil fluxes and the combined sensible-latent heat fluxes.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02979.pdf,"Ruiyue Huang, Claire E.

New affine invariant ensemble samplers and their dimensional scaling,"We introduce some new affine invariant ensemble samplers that are easy to construct and improve upon existing widely used algorithms, especially for high-dimensional problems. Specifically, we propose a derivative-free ensemble side move sampler that performs favorably compared to popular samplers in the \texttt{emcee} package. Additionally, we develop a class of derivative-based ensemble Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) samplers with affine invariance, which outperform standard HMC without affine invariance when sampling highly skewed distributions. We provide asymptotic scaling analysis for high-dimensional Gaussian targets to further elucidate the properties of these affine invariant ensemble samplers. In particular, with derivative information, the affine invariant ensemble HMC can scale much better with dimension compared to derivative-free ensemble samplers.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02987.pdf,Yifan Chen,stat.CO
Modeling the Impact of Group Interactions on Climate-related Opinion Change in Reddit,"Opinion dynamics models describe the evolution of behavioral changes within social networks and are essential for informing strategies aimed at fostering positive collective changes, such as climate action initiatives. When applied to social media interactions, these models typically represent social exchanges in a dyadic format to allow for a convenient encoding of interactions into a graph where edges represent the flow of information from one individual to another. However, this structural assumption fails to adequately reflect the nature of group discussions prevalent on many social media platforms. To address this limitation, we present a temporal hypergraph model that effectively captures the group dynamics inherent in conversational threads, and we apply it to discussions about climate change on Reddit. This model predicts temporal shifts in stance towards climate issues at the level of individual users. In contrast to traditional studies in opinion dynamics that typically rely on simulations or limited empirical validation, our approach is tested against a comprehensive ground truth estimated by a large language model at the level of individual user comments. Our findings demonstrate that using hypergraphs to model group interactions yields superior predictions of the microscopic dynamics of opinion formation, compared to state-of-the-art models based on dyadic interactions. Although our research contributes to the understanding of these complex social systems, significant challenges remain in capturing the nuances of how opinions are formed and evolve within online spaces.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02989.pdf,"Alessia Antelmi, Carmine Spagnuolo, Luca Maria Aiello",physics.soc-ph
Proof Complexity and Feasible Interpolation,"This is a survey on propositional proof complexity aimed at introducing the basics of the field with a particular focus on a method known as feasible interpolation. This method is used to construct ""hard theorems"" for several proof systems for both classical and non-classical logics. Here, a ""hard theorem"" refers to a theorem in the logic whose shortest proofs are super-polynomially long in the length of the theorem itself. To make this survey more accessible, we only assume a basic familiarity with propositional, modal, and first-order logic, as well as a basic understanding of the key concepts in computational complexity, such as the definitions of the classes $\mathbf{NP}$ and $\mathbf{PSPACE}$.

Modeling Spatial Extremes using Non-Gaussian Spatial Autoregressive Models via Convolutional Neural Networks,"Data derived from remote sensing or numerical simulations often have a regular gridded structure and are large in volume, making it challenging to find accurate spatial models that can fill in missing grid cells or simulate the process effectively, especially in the presence of spatial heterogeneity and heavy-tailed marginal distributions. To overcome this issue, we present a spatial autoregressive modeling framework, which maps observations at a location and its neighbors to independent random variables. This is a highly flexible modeling approach and well-suited for non-Gaussian fields, providing simpler interpretability. In particular, we consider the SAR model with Generalized Extreme Value distribution innovations to combine the observation at a central grid location with its neighbors, capturing extreme spatial behavior based on the heavy-tailed innovations. While these models are fast to simulate by exploiting the sparsity of the key matrices in the computations, the maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters is prohibitive due to the intractability of the likelihood, making optimization challenging. To overcome this, we train a convolutional neural network on a large training set that covers a useful parameter space, and then use the trained network for fast parameter estimation. Finally, we apply this model to analyze annual maximum precipitation data from ERA-Interim-driven Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations, allowing us to explore its spatial extreme behavior across North America.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03034.pdf,"Sweta Rai, Douglas W.

Dual Prompting for Diverse Count-level PET Denoising,"The to-be-denoised positron emission tomography (PET) volumes are inherent with diverse count levels, which imposes challenges for a unified model to tackle varied cases. In this work, we resort to the recently flourished prompt learning to achieve generalizable PET denoising with different count levels. Specifically, we propose dual prompts to guide the PET denoising in a divide-and-conquer manner, i.e., an explicitly count-level prompt to provide the specific prior information and an implicitly general denoising prompt to encode the essential PET denoising knowledge. Then, a novel prompt fusion module is developed to unify the heterogeneous prompts, followed by a prompt-feature interaction module to inject prompts into the features. The prompts are able to dynamically guide the noise-conditioned denoising process. Therefore, we are able to efficiently train a unified denoising model for various count levels, and deploy it to different cases with personalized prompts. We evaluated on 1940 low-count PET 3D volumes with uniformly randomly selected 13-22\% fractions of events from 97 $^{18}$F-MK6240 tau PET studies. It shows our dual prompting can largely improve the performance with informed count-level and outperform the count-conditional model.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03037.pdf,"Xiaofeng Liu, Yongsong Huang, Thibault Marin, Samira Vafay Eslahi, Tiss Amal, Yanis Chemli, Keith Johnson, Georges El Fakhri, Jinsong Ouyang",eess.IV
Asymptotically short generalizations of $t$-design curves,"Ehler and Gr\""{o}chenig posed the question of finding $t$-design curves $\gamma_t$$\unicode{x2013}$curves whose associated line integrals exactly average all degree at most $t$ polynomials$\unicode{x2013}$on $S^d$ of asymptotically optimal arc length $\ell(\gamma_t)\asymp t^{d-1}$ as $t\to\infty$. This work investigates analogues of this question for $\textit{weighted}$ and $\textit{$\varepsilon_t$-approximate $t$-design curves}$, proving existence of such curves $\gamma_t$ on $S^d$ of arc length $\ell(\gamma_t)\asymp t^{d-1}$ as $t\to\infty$ for all $d\in\Bbb N_+$ in the weighted setting (in which case such curves are asymptotically optimal) and all odd $d\in\Bbb N_+$ in the approximate setting (where we have $\varepsilon_t\asymp1/t$ as $t\to\infty$).

USF Spectral Estimation: Prevalence of Gaussian Cram\'er-Rao Bounds Despite Modulo Folding,"Spectral Estimation (SpecEst) is a core area of signal processing with a history spanning two centuries and applications across various fields. With the advent of digital acquisition, SpecEst algorithms have been widely applied to tasks like frequency super-resolution. However, conventional digital acquisition imposes a trade-off: for a fixed bit budget, one can optimize either signal dynamic range or digital resolution (noise floor), but not both simultaneously. The Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF) overcomes this limitation using modulo non-linearity in analog hardware, enabling a novel approach to SpecEst (USF-SpecEst). However, USF-SpecEst requires new theoretical and algorithmic developments to handle folded samples effectively. In this paper, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao Bounds (CRBs) for SpecEst with noisy modulo-folded samples and reveal a surprising result: the CRBs for USF-SpecEst are scaled versions of the Gaussian CRBs for conventional samples. Numerical experiments validate these bounds, providing a benchmark for USF-SpecEst and facilitating its practical deployment.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03098.pdf,"Ruiming Guo, Ayush Bhandari",eess.SP

STG: Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network with Fusion and Spatiotemporal Decoupling Learning for Prognostic Prediction of Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis,"We propose a multimodal spatiotemporal graph neural network (STG) framework to predict colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) progression. Current clinical models do not effectively integrate the tumor's spatial heterogeneity, dynamic evolution, and complex multimodal data relationships, limiting their predictive accuracy. Our STG framework combines preoperative CT imaging and clinical data into a heterogeneous graph structure, enabling joint modeling of tumor distribution and temporal evolution through spatial topology and cross-modal edges. The framework uses GraphSAGE to aggregate spatiotemporal neighborhood information and leverages supervised and contrastive learning strategies to enhance the model's ability to capture temporal features and improve robustness. A lightweight version of the model reduces parameter count by 78.55%, maintaining near-state-of-the-art performance. The model jointly optimizes recurrence risk regression and survival analysis tasks, with contrastive loss improving feature representational discriminability and cross-modal consistency. Experimental results on the MSKCC CRLM dataset show a time-adjacent accuracy of 85% and a mean absolute error of 1.1005, significantly outperforming existing methods. The innovative heterogeneous graph construction and spatiotemporal decoupling mechanism effectively uncover the associations between dynamic tumor microenvironment changes and prognosis, providing reliable quantitative support for personalized treatment decisions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03123.pdf,"Yiran Zhu, Wei Yang, Yan su, Zesheng Li, Chengchang Pan, Honggang Qi",eess.IV
HMAE: Self-Supervised Few-Shot Learning for Quantum Spin Systems,"Quantum machine learning for spin and molecular systems faces critical challenges of scarce labeled data and computationally expensive simulations. To address these limitations, we introduce Hamiltonian-Masked Autoencoding (HMAE), a novel self-supervised framework that pre-trains transformers on unlabeled quantum Hamiltonians, enabling efficient few-shot transfer learning. Unlike random masking approaches, HMAE employs a physics-informed strategy based on quantum information theory to selectively mask Hamiltonian terms based on their physical significance. Experiments on 12,500 quantum Hamiltonians (60% real-world, 40% synthetic) demonstrate that HMAE achieves 85.3% $\pm$ 1.5% accuracy in phase classification and 0.15 $\pm$ 0.02 eV MAE in ground state energy prediction with merely 10 labeled examples - a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.01) over classical graph neural networks (78.1% $\pm$ 2.1%) and quantum neural networks (76.8% $\pm$ 2.3%). Our method's primary advantage is exceptional sample efficiency - reducing required labeled examples by 3-5x compared to baseline methods - though we emphasize that ground truth values for fine-tuning and evaluation still require exact diagonalization or tensor networks. We explicitly acknowledge that our current approach is limited to small quantum systems (specifically limited to 12 qubits during training, with limited extension to 16-20 qubits in testing) and that, while promising within this regime, this size restriction prevents immediate application to larger systems of practical interest in materials science and quantum chemistry.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03140.pdf,"Ibne Farabi Shihab, Sanjeda Akter, Anuj Sharma",quant-ph
A Regeneration-based a Posteriori Error Bound for a Markov Chain Stationary Distribution Truncation Algorithm,"When the state space of a discrete state space positive recurrent Markov chain is infinite or very large, it becomes necessary to truncate the state space in order to facilitate numerical computation of the stationary distribution. This paper develops a new approach for bounding the truncation error that arises when computing approximations to the stationary distribution. This rigorous a posteriori error bound exploits the regenerative structure of the chain and assumes knowledge of a Lyapunov function. Because the bound is a posteriori (and leverages the computations done to calculate the stationary distribution itself), it tends to be much tighter than a priori bounds. The bound decomposes the regenerative cycle into a random number of excursions from a set $K$ defined in terms of the Lyapunov function into the complement of the truncation set $A$. The bound can be easily computed, and does not (for example) involve a linear program, as do some other error bounds.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03157.pdf,"Peter W. Glynn, Zeyu Zheng",math.PR
A Symbolic and Statistical Learning Framework to Discover Bioprocessing Regulatory Mechanism: Cell Culture Example,"Bioprocess mechanistic modeling is essential for advancing intelligent digital twin representation of biomanufacturing, yet challenges persist due to complex intracellular regulation, stochastic system behavior, and limited experimental data. This paper introduces a symbolic and statistical learning framework to identify key regulatory mechanisms and quantify model uncertainty. Bioprocess dynamics is formulated with stochastic differential equations characterizing intrinsic process variability, with a predefined set of candidate regulatory mechanisms constructed from biological knowledge. A Bayesian learning approach is developed, which is based on a joint learning of kinetic parameters and regulatory structure through a formulation of the mixture model. To enhance computational efficiency, a Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm with adjoint sensitivity analysis is developed for posterior exploration. Compared to state-of-the-art Bayesian inference approaches, the proposed framework achieves improved sample efficiency and robust model selection. An empirical study demonstrates its ability to recover missing regulatory mechanisms and improve model fidelity under data-limited conditions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03177.pdf,"Keilung Choy, Wei Xie, Keqi Wang",stat.ML
Weighted Average Gradients for Feature Attribution,"In explainable AI, Integrated Gradients (IG) is a widely adopted technique for assessing the significance of feature attributes of the input on model outputs by evaluating contributions from a baseline input to the current input. The choice of the baseline input significantly influences the resulting explanation. While the traditional Expected Gradients (EG) method assumes baselines can be uniformly sampled and averaged with equal weights, this study argues that baselines should not be treated equivalently. We introduce Weighted Average Gradients (WG), a novel approach that unsupervisedly evaluates baseline suitability and incorporates a strategy for selecting effective baselines. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that WG satisfies essential explanation method criteria and offers greater stability than prior approaches. Experimental results further confirm that WG outperforms EG across diverse scenarios, achieving an improvement of 10-35\% on main metrics. Moreover, by evaluating baselines, our method can filter a subset of effective baselines for each input to calculate explanations, maintaining high accuracy while reducing computational cost.

Lower Bounds for Greedy Teaching Set Constructions,"A fundamental open problem in learning theory is to characterize the best-case teaching dimension $\operatorname{TS}_{\min}$ of a concept class $\mathcal{C}$ with finite VC dimension $d$. Resolving this problem will, in particular, settle the conjectured upper bound on Recursive Teaching Dimension posed by [Simon and Zilles; COLT 2015]. Prior work used a natural greedy algorithm to construct teaching sets recursively, thereby proving upper bounds on $\operatorname{TS}_{\min}$, with the best known bound being $O(d^2)$ [Hu, Wu, Li, and Wang; COLT 2017]. In each iteration, this greedy algorithm chooses to add to the teaching set the $k$ labeled points that restrict the concept class the most. In this work, we prove lower bounds on the performance of this greedy approach for small $k$. Specifically, we show that for $k = 1$, the algorithm does not improve upon the halving-based bound of $O(\log(|\mathcal{C}|))$. Furthermore, for $k = 2$, we complement the upper bound of $O\left(\log(\log(|\mathcal{C}|))\right)$ from [Moran, Shpilka, Wigderson, and Yuhudayoff; FOCS 2015] with a matching lower bound. Most consequentially, our lower bound extends up to $k \le \lceil c d \rceil$ for small constant $c>0$: suggesting that studying higher-order interactions may be necessary to resolve the conjecture that $\operatorname{TS}_{\min} = O(d)$.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03223.pdf,"Spencer Compton, Chirag Pabbaraju, Nikita Zhivotovskiy",stat.ML
Chess variation entropy and engine relevance for humans,"Modern chess engines significantly outperform human players and are essential for evaluating positions and move quality. These engines assign a numerical evaluation $E$ to positions, indicating an advantage for either white or black, but similar evaluations can mask varying levels of move complexity. While some move sequences are straightforward, others demand near-perfect play, limiting the practical value of these evaluations for most players. To quantify this problem, we use entropy to measure the complexity of the principal variation (the sequence of best moves). Variations with forced moves have low entropy, while those with multiple viable alternatives have high entropy. Our results show that, except for experts, most human players struggle with high-entropy variations, especially when $|E|<100$ centipawns, which accounts for about $2/3$ of positions. This underscores the need for AI-generated evaluations to convey the complexity of underlying move sequences, as they often exceed typical human cognitive capabilities, reducing their practical utility.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03251.pdf,Marc Barthelemy,physics.soc-ph
Rapid diagnostics of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces using space-time-coding modulation,"Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a key technology for shaping smart wireless environments in next-generation wireless communication systems. To support the large-scale deployment of RISs, a reliable and efficient diagnostic method is essential to ensure optimal performance. In this work, a robust and efficient approach for RIS diagnostics is proposed using a space-time coding strategy with orthogonal codes. The method encodes the reflected signals from individual RIS elements into distinct code channels, enabling the recovery of channel power at the receiving terminals for fault identification. Theoretical analysis shows that the normally functioning elements generate high power in their respective code channels, whereas the faulty elements exhibit significantly lower power. This distinction enables rapid and accurate diagnostics of elements' operational states through simple signal processing techniques. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, even under high fault ratios and varying reception angles. Proof-of-principle experiments on two RIS prototypes are conducted, implementing two coding strategies: direct and segmented. Experimental results in a realistic scenario confirm the reliability of the diagnostic method, demonstrating its potential for large-scale RIS deployment in future wireless communication systems and radar applications.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03266.pdf,"Yi Ning Zheng, Lei Zhang, Xiao Qing Chen, Marco Rossi, Giuseppe Castaldi, Shuo Liu, Tie Jun Cui, Vincenzo Galdi",physics.optics
Fully discrete backward error analysis for the midpoint rule applied to the nonlinear Schroedinger equation,"The use of symplectic numerical schemes on Hamiltonian systems is widely known to lead to favorable long-time behaviour. While this phenomenon is thoroughly understood in the context of finite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems, much less is known in the context of Hamiltonian PDEs. In this work we provide the first dimension-independent backward error analysis for a Runge-Kutta-type method, the midpoint rule, which shows the existence of a modified energy for this method when applied to nonlinear Schroedinger equations regardless of the level of spatial discretisation. We use this to establish long-time stability of the numerical flow for the midpoint rule.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03271.pdf,"Erwan Faou (IRMAR, Inria, MINGUS), Georg Maierhofer (DAMTP), Katharina Schratz (LJLL)",math.AP
Simultaneous All-Pay Auctions with Budget Constraints,"The all-pay auction, a classic competitive model, is widely applied in scenarios such as political elections, sports competitions, and research and development, where all participants pay their bids regardless of winning or losing. However, in the traditional all-pay auction, players have no budget constraints, whereas in real-world scenarios, players typically face budget constraints. This paper studies the Nash equilibrium of two players with budget constraints across multiple heterogeneous items in a complete-information framework. The main contributions are as follows: (1) a comprehensive characterization of the Nash equilibrium in single-item auctions with asymmetric budgets and valuations; (2) the construction of a joint distribution Nash equilibrium for the two-item scenario; and (3) the construction of a joint distribution Nash equilibrium for the three-item scenario. Unlike the unconstrained all-pay auction, which always has a Nash equilibrium, a Nash equilibrium may not exist when players have budget constraints. Our findings highlight the intricate effects of budget constraints on bidding strategies, providing new perspectives and methodologies for theoretical analysis and practical applications of all-pay auctions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03291.pdf,"Yan Liu, Ying Qin, Zihe Wang",econ.TH
Exploring the application of quantum technologies to industrial and real-world use cases,"Recent advancements in quantum computing are leading to an era of practical utility, enabling the tackling of increasingly complex problems. The goal of this era is to leverage quantum computing to solve real-world problems in fields such as machine learning, optimization, and material simulation, using revolutionary quantum methods and machines. All this progress has been achieved even while being immersed in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, characterized by the current devices' inability to process medium-scale complex problems efficiently. Consequently, there has been a surge of interest in quantum algorithms in various fields. Multiple factors have played a role in this extraordinary development, with three being particularly noteworthy: (i) the development of larger devices with enhanced interconnections between their constituent qubits, (ii) the development of specialized frameworks, and (iii) the existence of well-known or ready-to-use hybrid schemes that simplify the method development process. In this context, this manuscript presents and overviews some recent contributions within this paradigm, showcasing the potential of quantum computing to emerge as a significant research catalyst in the fields of machine learning and optimization in the coming years.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03302.pdf,"Eneko Osaba, Esther Villar-Rodriguez, Izaskun Oregi",quant-ph
Qimax: Efficient quantum simulation via GPU-accelerated extended stabilizer formalism,"Simulating Clifford and near-Clifford circuits using the extended stabilizer formalism has become increasingly popular, particularly in quantum error correction. Compared to the state-vector approach, the extended stabilizer formalism can solve the same problems with fewer computational resources, as it operates on stabilizers rather than full state vectors. Most existing studies on near-Clifford circuits focus on balancing the trade-off between the number of ancilla qubits and simulation accuracy, often overlooking performance considerations. Furthermore, in the presence of high-rank stabilizers, performance is limited by the sequential property of the stabilizer formalism. In this work, we introduce a parallelized version of the extended stabilizer formalism, enabling efficient execution on multi-core devices such as GPU. Experimental results demonstrate that, in certain scenarios, our Python-based implementation outperforms state-of-the-art simulators such as Qiskit and Pennylane.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03307.pdf,"Vu Tuan Hai, Bui Cao Doanh, Le Vu Trung Duong, Pham Hoai Luan, Yasuhiko Nakashima",quant-ph
An Active Inference perspective on Neurofeedback Training,"Neurofeedback training (NFT) aims to teach self-regulation of brain activity through real-time feedback, but suffers from highly variable outcomes and poorly understood mechanisms, hampering its validation. To address these issues, we propose a formal computational model of the NFT closed loop. Using Active Inference, a Bayesian framework modelling perception, action, and learning, we simulate agents interacting with an NFT environment. This enables us to test the impact of design choices (e.g., feedback quality, biomarker validity) and subject factors (e.g., prior beliefs) on training. Simulations show that training effectiveness is sensitive to feedback noise or bias, and to prior beliefs (highlighting the importance of guiding instructions), but also reveal that perfect feedback is insufficient to guarantee high performance. This approach provides a tool for assessing and predicting NFT variability, interpret empirical data, and potentially develop personalized training protocols.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03308.pdf,"C\^ome Annicchiarico, Fabien Lotte, J\'er\'emie Mattout",q-bio.NC
GNN-enabled Precoding for Massive MIMO LEO Satellite Communications,"Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite communication is a critical component in the development of sixth generation (6G) networks. The integration of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology is being actively explored to enhance the performance of LEO satellite communications. However, the limited power of LEO satellites poses a significant challenge in improving communication energy efficiency (EE) under constrained power conditions. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods are increasingly recognized as promising solutions for optimizing energy consumption while enhancing system performance, thus enabling more efficient and sustainable communications. This paper proposes approaches to address the challenges associated with precoding in massive MIMO LEO satellite communications. First, we introduce an end-to-end graph neural network (GNN) framework that effectively reduces the computational complexity of traditional precoding methods. Next, we introduce a deep unfolding of the Dinkelbach algorithm and the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) approach to achieve enhanced EE, transforming iterative optimization processes into a structured neural network, thereby improving convergence speed and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we incorporate the Taylor expansion method to approximate matrix inversion within the GNN, enhancing both the interpretability and performance of the proposed method.

Solar Flare Forecast: A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms for Solar Flare Class Prediction,"Solar flares are among the most powerful and dynamic events in the solar system, resulting from the sudden release of magnetic energy stored in the Sun's atmosphere. These energetic bursts of electromagnetic radiation can release up to 10^32 erg of energy, impacting space weather and posing risks to technological infrastructure and therefore require accurate forecasting of solar flare occurrences and intensities. This study evaluates the predictive performance of three machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for classifying solar flares into 4 categories (B, C, M, X). Using the dataset of 13 SHARP parameters, the effectiveness of the models was evaluated in binary and multiclass classification tasks. The analysis utilized 8 principal components (PC), capturing 95% of data variance, and 100 PCs, capturing 97.5% of variance. Our approach uniquely combines binary and multiclass classification with different levels of dimensionality reduction, an innovative methodology not previously explored in the context of solar flare prediction. Employing a 10-fold stratified cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning ensured robust model evaluation. Our findings indicate that Random Forest and XGBoost consistently demonstrate strong performance across all metrics, benefiting significantly from increased dimensionality. The insights of this study enhance future research by optimizing dimensionality reduction techniques and informing model selection for astrophysical tasks. By integrating this newly acquired knowledge into future research, more accurate space weather forecasting systems can be developed, along with a deeper understanding of solar physics.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03385.pdf,Julia Bringewald,astro-ph.SR
Quantum Feature Space of a Qubit Coupled to an Arbitrary Bath,"Qubit control protocols have traditionally leveraged a characterisation of the qubit-bath coupling via its power spectral density. Previous work proposed the inference of noise operators that characterise the influence of a classical bath using a grey-box approach that combines deep neural networks with physics-encoded layers. This overall structure is complex and poses challenges in scaling and real-time operations. Here, we show that no expensive neural networks are needed and that this noise operator description admits an efficient parameterisation. We refer to the resulting parameter space as the \textit{quantum feature space} of the qubit dynamics resulting from the coupled bath. We show that the Euclidean distance defined over the quantum feature space provides an effective method for classifying noise processes in the presence of a given set of controls. Using the quantum feature space as the input space for a simple machine learning algorithm (random forest, in this case), we demonstrate that it can effectively classify the stationarity and the broad class of noise processes perturbing a qubit. Finally, we explore how control pulse parameters map to the quantum feature space.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03397.pdf,"Chris Wise, Akram Youssry, Alberto Peruzzo, Jo Plested, Matt Woolley",quant-ph

Information-theoretic reduction of deep neural networks to linear models in the overparametrized proportional regime,"We rigorously analyse fully-trained neural networks of arbitrary depth in the Bayesian optimal setting in the so-called proportional scaling regime where the number of training samples and width of the input and all inner layers diverge proportionally. We prove an information-theoretic equivalence between the Bayesian deep neural network model trained from data generated by a teacher with matching architecture, and a simpler model of optimal inference in a generalized linear model. This equivalence enables us to compute the optimal generalization error for deep neural networks in this regime. We thus prove the ""deep Gaussian equivalence principle"" conjectured in Cui et al. (2023) (arXiv:2302.00375). Our result highlights that in order to escape this ""trivialisation"" of deep neural networks (in the sense of reduction to a linear model) happening in the strongly overparametrized proportional regime, models trained from much more data have to be considered.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03577.pdf,"Francesco Camilli, Daria Tieplova, Eleonora Bergamin, Jean Barbier",math.ST
Decision Making under Model Misspecification: DRO with Robust Bayesian Ambiguity Sets,"Distributionally Robust Optimisation (DRO) protects risk-averse decision-makers by considering the worst-case risk within an ambiguity set of distributions based on the empirical distribution or a model. To further guard against finite, noisy data, model-based approaches admit Bayesian formulations that propagate uncertainty from the posterior to the decision-making problem. However, when the model is misspecified, the decision maker must stretch the ambiguity set to contain the data-generating process (DGP), leading to overly conservative decisions. We address this challenge by introducing DRO with Robust, to model misspecification, Bayesian Ambiguity Sets (DRO-RoBAS). These are Maximum Mean Discrepancy ambiguity sets centred at a robust posterior predictive distribution that incorporates beliefs about the DGP. We show that the resulting optimisation problem obtains a dual formulation in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space and we give probabilistic guarantees on the tolerance level of the ambiguity set. Our method outperforms other Bayesian and empirical DRO approaches in out-of-sample performance on the Newsvendor and Portfolio problems with various cases of model misspecification.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03585.pdf,"Charita Dellaporta, Patrick O'Hara, Theodoros Damoulas",stat.ML
Physics-Informed Sylvester Normalizing Flows for Bayesian Inference in Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy,"Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive technique to measure the metabolic composition of tissues, offering valuable insights into neurological disorders, tumor detection, and other metabolic dysfunctions. However, accurate metabolite quantification is hindered by challenges such as spectral overlap, low signal-to-noise ratio, and various artifacts. Traditional methods like linear-combination modeling are susceptible to ambiguities and commonly only provide a theoretical lower bound on estimation accuracy in the form of the Cram\'er-Rao bound. This work introduces a Bayesian inference framework using Sylvester normalizing flows (SNFs) to approximate posterior distributions over metabolite concentrations, enhancing quantification reliability. A physics-based decoder incorporates prior knowledge of MRS signal formation, ensuring realistic distribution representations.

Binding threshold units with artificial oscillatory neurons,"Artificial Kuramoto oscillatory neurons were recently introduced as an alternative to threshold units. Empirical evidence suggests that oscillatory units outperform threshold units in several tasks including unsupervised object discovery and certain reasoning problems. The proposed coupling mechanism for these oscillatory neurons is heterogeneous, combining a generalized Kuramoto equation with standard coupling methods used for threshold units. In this research note, we present a theoretical framework that clearly distinguishes oscillatory neurons from threshold units and establishes a coupling mechanism between them. We argue that, from a biological standpoint, oscillatory and threshold units realise distinct aspects of neural coding: roughly, threshold units model intensity of neuron firing, while oscillatory units facilitate information exchange by frequency modulation. To derive interaction between these two types of units, we constrain their dynamics by focusing on dynamical systems that admit Lyapunov functions. For threshold units, this leads to Hopfield associative memory model, and for oscillatory units it yields a specific form of generalized Kuramoto model. The resulting dynamical systems can be naturally coupled to form a Hopfield-Kuramoto associative memory model, which also admits a Lyapunov function. Various forms of coupling are possible. Notably, oscillatory neurons can be employed to implement a low-rank correction to the weight matrix of a Hopfield network. This correction can be viewed either as a form of Hebbian learning or as a popular LoRA method used for fine-tuning of large language models. We demonstrate the practical realization of this particular coupling through illustrative toy experiments.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03648.pdf,"Vladimir Fanaskov, Ivan Oseledets",q-bio.NC
Weighted Random Dot Product Graphs,"Modeling of intricate relational patterns % through the analysis structures of network data has become a cornerstone of contemporary statistical research and related data science fields. Networks, represented as graphs, offer a natural framework for this analysis. This paper extends the Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG) model to accommodate weighted graphs, markedly broadening the model's scope to scenarios where edges exhibit heterogeneous weight distributions. We propose a nonparametric weighted (W)RDPG model that assigns a sequence of latent positions to each node. Inner products of these nodal vectors specify the moments of their incident edge weights' distribution via moment-generating functions. In this way, and unlike prior art, the WRDPG can discriminate between weight distributions that share the same mean but differ in other higher-order moments. We derive statistical guarantees for an estimator of the nodal's latent positions adapted from the workhorse adjacency spectral embedding, establishing its consistency and asymptotic normality. We also contribute a generative framework that enables sampling of graphs that adhere to a (prescribed or data-fitted) WRDPG, facilitating, e.g., the analysis and testing of observed graph metrics using judicious reference distributions. The paper is organized to formalize the model's definition, the estimation (or nodal embedding) process and its guarantees, as well as the methodologies for generating weighted graphs, all complemented by illustrative and reproducible examples showcasing the WRDPG's effectiveness in various network analytic applications.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03649.pdf,"Bernardo Marenco, Paola Bermolen, Marcelo Fiori, Federico Larroca, Gonzalo Mateos",stat.ML
Vector valued optimal transport: from dynamic to static formulations,"Motivated by applications in classification of vector valued measures and multispecies PDE, we develop a theory that unifies existing notions of vector valued optimal transport, from dynamic formulations (\`a la Benamou-Brenier) to static formulations (\`a la Kantorovich). In our framework, vector valued measures are modeled as probability measures on a product space $\mathbb{R}^d \times G$, where $G$ is a weighted graph over a finite set of nodes and the graph geometry strongly influences the associated dynamic and static distances. We obtain sharp inequalities relating four notions of vector valued optimal transport and prove that the distances are mutually bi-H\""older equivalent. We discuss the theoretical and practical advantages of each metric and indicate potential applications in multispecies PDE and data analysis. In particular, one of the static formulations discussed in the paper is amenable to linearization, a technique that has been explored in recent years to accelerate the computation of pairwise optimal transport distances.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03670.pdf,"Katy Craig, Nicol\'as Garc\'ia Trillos, {\DJ}or{\dj}e Nikoli\'c",math.AP
Multi-modal cascade feature transfer for polymer property prediction,"In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach called multi-modal cascade model with feature transfer for polymer property prediction.Polymers are characterized by a composite of data in several different formats, including molecular descriptors and additive information as well as chemical structures. However, in conventional approaches, prediction models were often constructed using each type of data separately. Our model enables more accurate prediction of physical properties for polymers by combining features extracted from the chemical structure by graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) with features such as molecular descriptors and additive information. The predictive performance of the proposed method is empirically evaluated using several polymer datasets. We report that the proposed method shows high predictive performance compared to the baseline conventional approach using a single feature.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03704.pdf,"Kiichi Obuchi, Yuta Yahagi, Kiyohiko Toyama, Shukichi Tanaka, Kota Matsui",stat.ML
Policy Gradient Adaptive Control for the LQR: Indirect and Direct Approaches,"Motivated by recent advances of reinforcement learning and direct data-driven control, we propose policy gradient adaptive control (PGAC) for the linear quadratic regulator (LQR), which uses online closed-loop data to improve the control policy while maintaining stability. Our method adaptively updates the policy in feedback by descending the gradient of the LQR cost and is categorized as indirect, when gradients are computed via an estimated model, versus direct, when gradients are derived from data using sample covariance parameterization. Beyond the vanilla gradient, we also showcase the merits of the natural gradient and Gauss-Newton methods for the policy update. Notably, natural gradient descent bridges the indirect and direct PGAC, and the Gauss-Newton method of the indirect PGAC leads to an adaptive version of the celebrated Hewer's algorithm. To account for the uncertainty from noise, we propose a regularization method for both indirect and direct PGAC. For all the considered PGAC approaches, we show closed-loop stability and convergence of the policy to the optimal LQR gain. Simulations validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the robustness and computational efficiency of PGAC.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03706.pdf,"Feiran Zhao, Alessandro Chiuso, Florian D\""orfler",math.OC

Nonnegative Low-rank Matrix Recovery Can Have Spurious Local Minima,"The classical low-rank matrix recovery problem is well-known to exhibit \emph{benign nonconvexity} under the restricted isometry property (RIP): local optimization is guaranteed to converge to the global optimum, where the ground truth is recovered. We investigate whether benign nonconvexity continues to hold when the factor matrices are constrained to be elementwise nonnegative -- a common practical requirement. In the simple setting of a rank-1 nonnegative ground truth, we confirm that benign nonconvexity holds in the fully-observed case with RIP constant $\delta=0$. Surprisingly, however, this property fails to extend to the partially-observed case with any arbitrarily small RIP constant $\delta\to0^{+}$, irrespective of rank overparameterization. This finding exposes a critical theoretical gap: the continuity argument widely used to explain the empirical robustness of low-rank matrix recovery fundamentally breaks down once nonnegative constraints are imposed.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03717.pdf,Richard Y.

Accelerated Decentralized Constraint-Coupled Optimization: A Dual$^2$ Approach,"In this paper, we focus on a class of decentralized constraint-coupled optimization problem: $\min_{x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d_i}, i \in \mathcal{I}; y \in \mathbb{R}^p}$ $\sum_{i=1}^n\left(f_i(x_i) + g_i(x_i)\right) + h(y) \ \text{s.t.} \ \sum_{i=1}^{n}A_ix_i = y$, over an undirected and connected network of $n$ agents. Here, $f_i$, $g_i$, and $A_i$ represent private information of agent $i \in \mathcal{I} = \{1, \cdots, n\}$, while $h$ is public for all agents. Building on a novel dual$^2$ approach, we develop two accelerated algorithms for solving this problem: the inexact Dual$^2$ Accelerated (iD2A) gradient method and the Multi-consensus inexact Dual$^2$ Accelerated (MiD2A) gradient method. We demonstrate that both iD2A and MiD2A can guarantee asymptotic convergence under a milder condition on $h$ compared to existing algorithms. Furthermore, linear convergence is established under additional assumptions. By employing specialized saddle-point subproblem solvers, iD2A and MiD2A attain significantly lower communication and computational complexities than existing algorithms across various scenarios. Finally, we conduct several numerical experiments to validate our theoretical results and to showcase the superior performance of iD2A and MiD2A in practice.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03719.pdf,"Jingwang Li, Vincent Lau",math.OC
Decentralized Nonconvex Optimization under Heavy-Tailed Noise: Normalization and Optimal Convergence,"Heavy-tailed noise in nonconvex stochastic optimization has garnered increasing research interest, as empirical studies, including those on training attention models, suggest it is a more realistic gradient noise condition. This paper studies first-order nonconvex stochastic optimization under heavy-tailed gradient noise in a decentralized setup, where each node can only communicate with its direct neighbors in a predefined graph. Specifically, we consider a class of heavy-tailed gradient noise that is zero-mean and has only $p$-th moment for $p \in (1, 2]$. We propose GT-NSGDm, Gradient Tracking based Normalized Stochastic Gradient Descent with momentum, that utilizes normalization, in conjunction with gradient tracking and momentum, to cope with heavy-tailed noise on distributed nodes. We show that, when the communication graph admits primitive and doubly stochastic weights, GT-NSGDm guarantees, for the \textit{first} time in the literature, that the expected gradient norm converges at an optimal non-asymptotic rate $O\big(1/T^{(p-1)/(3p-2)}\big)$, which matches the lower bound in the centralized setup. When tail index $p$ is unknown, GT-NSGDm attains a non-asymptotic rate $O\big( 1/T^{(p-1)/(2p)} \big)$ that is, for $p < 2$, topology independent and has a speedup factor $n^{1-1/p}$ in terms of the number of nodes $n$. Finally, experiments on nonconvex linear regression with tokenized synthetic data and decentralized training of language models on a real-world corpus demonstrate that GT-NSGDm is more robust and efficient than baselines.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03736.pdf,"Shuhua Yu, Dusan Jakovetic, Soummya Kar",math.OC
The Weihrauch degree of finding Nash equilibria in multiplayer games,"Is there an algorithm that takes a game in normal form as input, and outputs a Nash equilibrium? If the payoffs are integers, the answer is yes, and lot of work has been done in its computational complexity. If the payoffs are permitted to be real numbers, the answer is no, for continuity reasons. It is worthwhile to investigate the precise degree of non-computability (the Weihrauch degree), since knowing the degree entails what other approaches are available (eg, is there a randomized algorithm with positive success change?). The two player case has already been fully classified, but the multiplayer case remains open and is addressed here. Our approach involves classifying the degree of finding roots of polynomials, and lifting this to systems of polynomial inequalities via cylindrical algebraic decomposition.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.00972.pdf,"Tonicha Crook, Arno Pauly",cs.LO
Autonomous Cooperative Transportation System involving Multi-Aerial Robots with Variable Attachment Mechanism,"Cooperative transportation by multi-aerial robots has the potential to support various payloads and improve failsafe against dropping. Furthermore, changing the attachment positions of robots according payload characteristics increases the stability of transportation. However, there are almost no transportation systems capable of scaling to the payload weight and size and changing the optimal attachment positions. To address this issue, we propose a cooperative transportation system comprising autonomously executable software and suitable hardware, covering the entire process, from pre-takeoff setting to controlled flight. The proposed system decides the formation of the attachment positions by prioritizing controllability based on the center of gravity obtained from Bayesian estimations with robot pairs. We investigated the cooperative transportation of an unknown payload larger than that of whole carrier robots through numerical simulations. Furthermore, we performed cooperative transportation of an unknown payload (with a weight of about 3.2 kg and maximum length of 1.76 m) using eight robots. The proposed system was found to be versatile with regard to handling unknown payloads with different shapes and center-of-gravity positions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10575.pdf,"Koshi Oishi, Tomohiko Jimbo",cs.RO
Cooperative Transportation using Multiple Single-Rotor Robots and Decentralized Control for Unknown Payloads,"Cooperative transportation via multiple aerial robots has the potential to support various payloads and reduce the chances of them being dropped. Furthermore, autonomously controlled robots render the system scalable with respect to the payload. In this study, a cooperative transportation system was developed using rigidly attached single-rotor robots, and a decentralized controller was proposed to guarantee asymptotic stability of the error dynamics for unknown strictly positive real systems. A feedback controller was used to transform unstable systems into strictly positive real ones considering the shared attachment positions. First, the cooperative transportation of unknown payloads with different shapes larger than the carrier robots was investigated via numerical simulations. Second, cooperative transportation of an unknown payload (with a weight of approximately 2.7 kg and maximum length of 1.6 m) was demonstrated using eight robots, even under robot failure. Finally, the proposed system was shown to be capable of carrying an unknown payload, even if the attachment positions were not shared, that is, even if asymptotic stability was not strictly guaranteed.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.01963.pdf,"Koshi Oishi, Yasushi Amano, Tomohiko Jimbo",cs.RO
q-Learning in Continuous Time,"We study the continuous-time counterpart of Q-learning for reinforcement learning (RL) under the entropy-regularized, exploratory diffusion process formulation introduced by Wang et al. (2020). As the conventional (big) Q-function collapses in continuous time, we consider its first-order approximation and coin the term ``(little) q-function"". This function is related to the instantaneous advantage rate function as well as the Hamiltonian. We develop a ``q-learning"" theory around the q-function that is independent of time discretization. Given a stochastic policy, we jointly characterize the associated q-function and value function by martingale conditions of certain stochastic processes, in both on-policy and off-policy settings. We then apply the theory to devise different actor-critic algorithms for solving underlying RL problems, depending on whether or not the density function of the Gibbs measure generated from the q-function can be computed explicitly. One of our algorithms interprets the well-known Q-learning algorithm SARSA, and another recovers a policy gradient (PG) based continuous-time algorithm proposed in Jia and Zhou (2022b). Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to compare the performance of our algorithms with those of PG-based algorithms in Jia and Zhou (2022b) and time-discretized conventional Q-learning algorithms.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00713.pdf,"Yanwei Jia, Xun Yu Zhou",cs.LG
Clock Distribution with Gradient TRIX,"Gradient clock synchronization (GCS) algorithms minimize the worst-case clock offset between the nodes in a distributed network of diameter $D$ and size $n$. They achieve optimal offsets of $\Theta(\log D)$ locally, i.e. between adjacent nodes as shown by Lenzen et al., and $\Theta(D)$ globally as shown by Biaz and Welch. As demonstrated in the work of Bund et al., this is a highly promising approach for improved clocking schemes for large-scale synchronous Systems-on-Chip (SoC). Unfortunately, in large systems, faults hinder their practical use. State of the art fault-tolerant, as presented by Bund et al., has a drawback that is fatal in this setting: It relies on node and edge replication. For $f=1$, this translates to at least $16$-fold edge replication and high degree nodes, far from the optimum of $2f+1=3$ for tolerating up to $f$ faulty neighbors.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.05073.pdf,"Christoph Lenzen, Shreyas Srinivas",cs.DC
Synthesizing Proxy Applications for MPI Programs,"Proxy applications (proxy-apps) are basic tools for evaluating the performance of specific workloads on high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Since the development of high-fidelity proxy-apps, which exhibit similar performance characteristics as corresponding production applications, is labor-intensive, synthetic proxy-apps are created as a useful supplement to manually developed proxy-apps. To thoroughly resemble performance characteristics of HPC applications represented by Message Passing Interface (MPI) programs, we propose Siesta, a novel framework to automatically synthesize proxy-apps based on communication-computation traces. Given an MPI program, Siesta synthesizes parameterized code snippets to mimic computation behaviors in different execution periods, and combines the code snippets and MPI function records into an event trace. It then extracts program behavior patterns from the trace as grammars and finally transforms the grammars into a synthetic proxy-app. We evaluate the proposed methods on representative MPI programs with various environments. The results show that our synthetic proxy-apps can precisely approximate the performance characteristics of MPI programs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.06062.pdf,"Jiyu Luo, Tao Yan, Qingguo Xu, Jingwei Sun, Guangzhong Sun",cs.DC
VecFontSDF: Learning to Reconstruct and Synthesize High-quality Vector Fonts via Signed Distance Functions,"Font design is of vital importance in the digital content design and modern printing industry. Developing algorithms capable of automatically synthesizing vector fonts can significantly facilitate the font design process. However, existing methods mainly concentrate on raster image generation, and only a few approaches can directly synthesize vector fonts. This paper proposes an end-to-end trainable method, VecFontSDF, to reconstruct and synthesize high-quality vector fonts using signed distance functions (SDFs). Specifically, based on the proposed SDF-based implicit shape representation, VecFontSDF learns to model each glyph as shape primitives enclosed by several parabolic curves, which can be precisely converted to quadratic B\'ezier curves that are widely used in vector font products. In this manner, most image generation methods can be easily extended to synthesize vector fonts. Qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted on a publicly-available dataset demonstrate that our method obtains high-quality results on several tasks, including vector font reconstruction, interpolation, and few-shot vector font synthesis, markedly outperforming the state of the art.

A Unified Framework for Exploratory Learning-Aided Community Detection Under Topological Uncertainty,"In social networks, the discovery of community structures has received considerable attention as a fundamental problem in various network analysis tasks. However, due to privacy concerns or access restrictions, the network structure is often uncertain, thereby rendering established community detection approaches ineffective without costly network topology acquisition. To tackle this challenge, we present META-CODE, a unified framework for detecting overlapping communities via exploratory learning aided by easy-to-collect node metadata when networks are topologically unknown (or only partially known). Specifically, META-CODE consists of three iterative steps in addition to the initial network inference step: 1) node-level community-affiliation embeddings based on graph neural networks (GNNs) trained by our new reconstruction loss, 2) network exploration via community-affiliation-based node queries, and 3) network inference using an edge connectivity-based Siamese neural network model from the explored network. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets including two large networks, we demonstrate: (a) the superiority of META-CODE over benchmark community detection methods, achieving remarkable gains up to 65.55% on the Facebook dataset over the best competitor among our selected competitive methods in terms of normalized mutual information (NMI), (b) the impact of each module in META-CODE, (c) the effectiveness of node queries in META-CODE based on empirical evaluations and theoretical findings, and (d) the convergence of the inferred network.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04497.pdf,"Yu Hou, Cong Tran, Ming Li, Won-Yong Shin",cs.SI
Infrared Image Deturbulence Restoration Using Degradation Parameter-Assisted Wide & Deep Learning,"Infrared images captured under turbulent conditions are degraded by complex geometric distortions and blur. We address infrared deturbulence as an image restoration task, proposing DparNet, a parameter-assisted multi-frame network with a wide & deep architecture. DparNet learns a degradation prior (key parameter matrix) directly from degraded images without external knowledge. Its wide & deep architecture uses these learned parameters to directly modulate restoration, achieving spatially and intensity adaptive results. Evaluated on dedicated infrared deturbulence (49,744 images) and visible image denoising (109,536 images) datasets, DparNet significantly outperforms State-of-the-Art (SOTA) methods in restoration performance and efficiency. Notably, leveraging these parameters improves PSNR by 0.6-1.1 dB with less than 2% increase in model parameters and computational complexity. Our work demonstrates that degraded images hide key degradation information that can be learned and utilized to boost adaptive image restoration.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18708.pdf,"Yi Lu, Yadong Wang, Xingbo Jiang, Xiangzhi Bai",cs.CV
Scratch Team of Single-Rotor Robots and Decentralized Cooperative Transportation with Robot Failure,"Achieving cooperative transportation by aerial robot teams ensures flexibility regarding payloads and robustness against failures, which has garnered significant attention in recent years. This study proposes a flexible decentralized controller for robots and the shapes of payloads in a cooperative transport task using multiple single-rotor robots. The proposed controller is robust to mass and center of mass (COM) fluctuations and robot failures. Moreover, it possesses asymptotic stability against dynamics errors. Additionally, the controller supports heterogeneous single-rotor robots. Thus, robots with different specifications and deterioration may be effectively utilized for cooperative transportation. This performance is particularly effective for robot reuse. To achieve the aforementioned performance, the controller consists of a parallel structure comprising two controllers: a feedback controller, which renders the system strictly positive real, and a nonlinear controller, which renders the object asymptotic to the target. First, we confirm cooperative transportation using 8 and 10 robots for two shapes through numerical simulation. Subsequently, the cooperative transportation of a rectangle payload (with a weight of approximately 3 kg and maximum length of 1.6 m) is demonstrated using a robot team consisting of three types of robots, even under robot failure and fluctuation in the COM.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.00705.pdf,"Koshi Oishi, Yasushi Amano, Jimbo Tomohiko",cs.RO
Semi-supervised Underwater Image Enhancement Using A Physics-Aware Triple-Stream Network,"Underwater images normally suffer from degradation due to the transmission medium of water bodies. Both traditional prior-based approaches and deep learning-based methods have been used to address this problem. However, the inflexible assumption of the former often impairs their effectiveness in handling diverse underwater scenes, while the generalization of the latter to unseen images is usually weakened by insufficient data. In this study, we leverage both the physics-based Image Formation Model (IFM) and deep learning techniques for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE). To this end, we propose a novel Physics-Aware Triple-Stream Underwater Image Enhancement Network, i.e., PATS-UIENet, which comprises a Direct Signal Transmission Estimation Steam (D-Stream), a Backscatter Signal Transmission Estimation Steam (B-Stream) and an Ambient Light Estimation Stream (A-Stream). This network fulfills the UIE task by explicitly estimating the degradation parameters of a revised IFM. We also adopt an IFM-inspired semi-supervised learning framework, which exploits both the labeled and unlabeled images, to address the issue of insufficient data. To our knowledge, such a physics-aware deep network and the IFM-inspired semi-supervised learning framework have not been used for the UIE task before. Our method performs better than, or at least comparably to, sixteen baselines across six testing sets in the degradation estimation and UIE tasks. These promising results should be due to the fact that the proposed method can not only model the degradation but also learn the characteristics of diverse underwater scenes.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11470.pdf,"Hao Qi, Shixuan Xu, Xinghui Dong",cs.CV
ESTA: An Efficient Spatial-Temporal Range Aggregation Query Processing Algorithm for UAV Networks,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks are increasingly deployed in military and civilian applications, serving as critical platforms for data collection. Users frequently require aggregated statistical information derived from historical sensory data within specific spatial and temporal boundaries. To address this, users submit aggregation query requests with spatial-temporal constraints to target UAVs that store the relevant data. These UAVs process and return the query results, which can be aggregated within the network during transmission to conserve energy and bandwidth-resources that are inherently limited in UAV networks. However,the dynamic topology caused by UAV mobility, coupled with these resource constraints, makes efficient in-network aggregation challenging without compromising user query delay. To the best of our knowledge, existing research has yet to adequately explore spatial-temporal range aggregation queries in the context of UAV networks. In this paper, we propose ESTA, an Efficient Spatial-Temporal range Aggregation query processing algorithm tailored for UAV networks. ESTA leverages pre-planned UAV trajectories to construct a topology change graph that models the network's evolving connectivity. It then employs an efficient shortest path algorithm to determine the minimum query response delay. Subsequently, while adhering to user-specified delay constraints, ESTA transforms the in-network aggregation process into a series of set cover problems, which are solved recursively to build a Spatial-Temporal Aggregation Tree (STAT). This tree enables the identification of an energy-efficient routing path for aggregating and delivering query results. Extensive simulations demonstrate that ESTA reduces energy consumption by more than 50% compared to a baseline algorithm, all while satisfying the required query delay.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11977.pdf,"Liang Liu, Wenbin Zhai, Xin Li, Youwei Ding, Wanying Lu, Ran Wang",cs.DC
Breaking On-Chip Communication Anonymity using Flow Correlation Attacks,"Network-on-Chip (NoC) is widely used to facilitate communication between components in sophisticated System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. Security of the on-chip communication is crucial because exploiting any vulnerability in shared NoC would be a goldmine for an attacker that puts the entire computing infrastructure at risk. We investigate the security strength of existing anonymous routing protocols in NoC architectures, making two pivotal contributions. Firstly, we develop and perform a machine learning (ML)-based flow correlation attack on existing anonymous routing techniques in Network-on-Chip (NoC) systems, revealing that they provide only packet-level anonymity. Secondly, we propose a novel, lightweight anonymous routing protocol featuring outbound traffic tunneling and traffic obfuscation. This protocol is designed to provide robust defense against ML-based flow correlation attacks, ensuring both packet-level and flow-level anonymity. Experimental evaluation using both real and synthetic traffic demonstrates that our proposed attack successfully deanonymizes state-of-the-art anonymous routing in NoC architectures with high accuracy (up to 99%) for diverse traffic patterns. It also reveals that our lightweight anonymous routing protocol can defend against ML-based attacks with minor hardware and performance overhead.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15687.pdf,"Hansika Weerasena, Prabhat Mishra",cs.CR
Towards A Robust Group-level Emotion Recognition via Uncertainty-Aware Learning,"Group-level emotion recognition (GER) is an inseparable part of human behavior analysis, aiming to recognize an overall emotion in a multi-person scene. However, the existing methods are devoted to combing diverse emotion cues while ignoring the inherent uncertainties under unconstrained environments, such as congestion and occlusion occurring within a group. Additionally, since only group-level labels are available, inconsistent emotion predictions among individuals in one group can confuse the network. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware learning (UAL) method to extract more robust representations for GER. By explicitly modeling the uncertainty of each individual, we utilize stochastic embedding drawn from a Gaussian distribution instead of deterministic point embedding. This representation captures the probabilities of different emotions and generates diverse predictions through this stochasticity during the inference stage. Furthermore, uncertainty-sensitive scores are adaptively assigned as the fusion weights of individuals' face within each group. Moreover, we develop an image enhancement module to enhance the model's robustness against severe noise. The overall three-branch model, encompassing face, object, and scene component, is guided by a proportional-weighted fusion strategy and integrates the proposed uncertainty-aware method to produce the final group-level output. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method across three widely used databases.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04306.pdf,"Qing Zhu, Qirong Mao, Jialin Zhang, Xiaohua Huang, Wenming Zheng",cs.CV
ParFam -- (Neural Guided) Symbolic Regression Based on Continuous Global Optimization,"The problem of symbolic regression (SR) arises in many different applications, such as identifying physical laws or deriving mathematical equations describing the behavior of financial markets from given data. Various methods exist to address the problem of SR, often based on genetic programming. However, these methods are usually complicated and involve various hyperparameters. In this paper, we present our new approach ParFam that utilizes parametric families of suitable symbolic functions to translate the discrete symbolic regression problem into a continuous one, resulting in a more straightforward setup compared to current state-of-the-art methods. In combination with a global optimizer, this approach results in a highly effective method to tackle the problem of SR. We theoretically analyze the expressivity of ParFam and demonstrate its performance with extensive numerical experiments based on the common SR benchmark suit SRBench, showing that we achieve state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we present an extension incorporating a pre-trained transformer network DL-ParFam to guide ParFam, accelerating the optimization process by up to two magnitudes.

Co-NavGPT: Multi-Robot Cooperative Visual Semantic Navigation Using Vision Language Models,"Visual target navigation is a critical capability for autonomous robots operating in unknown environments, particularly in human-robot interaction scenarios. While classical and learning-based methods have shown promise, most existing approaches lack common-sense reasoning and are typically designed for single-robot settings, leading to reduced efficiency and robustness in complex environments. To address these limitations, we introduce Co-NavGPT, a novel framework that integrates a Vision Language Model (VLM) as a global planner to enable common-sense multi-robot visual target navigation. Co-NavGPT aggregates sub-maps from multiple robots with diverse viewpoints into a unified global map, encoding robot states and frontier regions. The VLM uses this information to assign frontiers across the robots, facilitating coordinated and efficient exploration. Experiments on the Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) demonstrate that Co-NavGPT outperforms existing baselines in terms of success rate and navigation efficiency, without requiring task-specific training. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of semantic priors from the VLM. We also validate the framework in real-world scenarios using quadrupedal robots.

Aligning Data Selection with Performance: Performance-driven Reinforcement Learning for Active Learning in Object Detection,"Active learning strategies aim to train high-performance models with minimal labeled data by selecting the most informative instances for labeling. However, existing methods for assessing data informativeness often fail to align directly with task model performance metrics, such as mean average precision (mAP) in object detection. This paper introduces Mean-AP Guided Reinforced Active Learning for Object Detection (MGRAL), a novel approach that leverages the concept of expected model output changes as informativeness for deep detection networks, directly optimizing the sampling strategy using mAP. MGRAL employs a reinforcement learning agent based on LSTM architecture to efficiently navigate the combinatorial challenge of batch sample selection and the non-differentiable nature between performance and selected batches. The agent optimizes selection using policy gradient with mAP improvement as the reward signal. To address the computational intensity of mAP estimation with unlabeled samples, we implement fast look-up tables, ensuring real-world feasibility. We evaluate MGRAL on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmarks across various backbone architectures. Our approach demonstrates strong performance, establishing a new paradigm in reinforcement learning-based active learning for object detection.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08387.pdf,"Zhixuan Liang, Xingyu Zeng, Rui Zhao, Ping Luo",cs.CV
Closed-Form Diffusion Models,"Score-based generative models (SGMs) sample from a target distribution by iteratively transforming noise using the score function of the perturbed target. For any finite training set, this score function can be evaluated in closed form, but the resulting SGM memorizes its training data and does not generate novel samples. In practice, one approximates the score by training a neural network via score-matching. The error in this approximation promotes generalization, but neural SGMs are costly to train and sample, and the effective regularization this error provides is not well-understood theoretically. In this work, we instead explicitly smooth the closed-form score to obtain an SGM that generates novel samples without training. We analyze our model and propose an efficient nearest-neighbor-based estimator of its score function.

The main limitations of the basic Loyd-based algorithm (LB) concern deadlock issues and the failure to address dynamic constraints effectively. Our contribution is twofold. First, we show how RBL is able to provide safety and convergence to the goal region without relying on communication between robots, nor synchronization between the robots. We considered different dynamic constraints with control inputs saturation. Second, we show that the Lloyd-based algorithm (without rules) can be successfully used as a safety layer for learning-based approaches, leading to non-negligible benefits. We further prove the soundness, reliability, and scalability of RBL through extensive simulations, comparisons with the state of the art, and experimental validations on small-scale car-like robots, unicycle-like robots, omnidirectional robots, and aerial robots on the field.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.19511.pdf,"Manuel Boldrer, Alvaro Serra-Gomez, Lorenzo Lyons, Vit Kratky, Javier Alonso-Mora, Laura Ferranti",cs.RO
Revealing CNN Architectures via Side-Channel Analysis in Dataflow-based Inference Accelerators,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in various domains, including image recognition, medical diagnosis and autonomous driving. Recent advances in dataflow-based CNN accelerators have enabled CNN inference in resource-constrained edge devices. These dataflow accelerators utilize inherent data reuse of convolution layers to process CNN models efficiently. Concealing the architecture of CNN models is critical for privacy and security. This article evaluates memory-based side-channel information to recover CNN architectures from dataflow-based CNN inference accelerators. The proposed attack exploits spatial and temporal data reuse of the dataflow mapping on CNN accelerators and architectural hints to recover the structure of CNN models. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed side-channel attack can recover the structures of popular CNN models, namely, Lenet, Alexnet, VGGnet16, and YOLOv2.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.00579.pdf,"Hansika Weerasena, Prabhat Mishra",cs.CR
Causal Structure Representation Learning of Confounders in Latent Space for Recommendation,"Inferring user preferences from the historical feedback of users is a valuable problem in recommender systems. Conventional approaches often rely on the assumption that user preferences in the feedback data are equivalent to the real user preferences without additional noise, which simplifies the problem modeling. However, there are various confounders during user-item interactions, such as weather and even the recommendation system itself. Therefore, neglecting the influence of confounders will result in inaccurate user preferences and suboptimal performance of the model. Furthermore, the unobservability of confounders poses a challenge in further addressing the problem. To address these issues, we refine the problem and propose a more rational solution. Specifically, we consider the influence of confounders, disentangle them from user preferences in the latent space, and employ causal graphs to model their interdependencies without specific labels. By cleverly combining local and global causal graphs, we capture the user-specificity of confounders on user preferences. We theoretically demonstrate the identifiability of the obtained causal graph. Finally, we propose our model based on Variational Autoencoders, named Causal Structure representation learning of Confounders in latent space (CSC). We conducted extensive experiments on one synthetic dataset and five real-world datasets, demonstrating the superiority of our model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the learned causal representations of confounders are controllable, potentially offering users fine-grained control over the objectives of their recommendation lists with the learned causal graphs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.03382.pdf,"Hangtong Xu, Yuanbo Xu, Chaozhuo Li, Fuzhen Zhuang",cs.IR
Paragraph-to-Image Generation with Information-Enriched Diffusion Model,"Text-to-image (T2I) models have recently experienced rapid development, achieving astonishing performance in terms of fidelity and textual alignment capabilities. However, given a long paragraph (up to 512 words), these generation models still struggle to achieve strong alignment and are unable to generate images depicting complex scenes. In this paper, we introduce an information-enriched diffusion model for paragraph-to-image generation task, termed ParaDiffusion, which delves into the transference of the extensive semantic comprehension capabilities of large language models to the task of image generation. At its core is using a large language model (e.g., Llama V2) to encode long-form text, followed by fine-tuning with LORA to alignthe text-image feature spaces in the generation task. To facilitate the training of long-text semantic alignment, we also curated a high-quality paragraph-image pair dataset, namely ParaImage. This dataset contains a small amount of high-quality, meticulously annotated data, and a large-scale synthetic dataset with long text descriptions being generated using a vision-language model. Experiments demonstrate that ParaDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art models (SD XL, DeepFloyd IF) on ViLG-300 and ParaPrompts, achieving up to 15% and 45% human voting rate improvements for visual appeal and text faithfulness, respectively. The code and dataset will be released to foster community research on long-text alignment.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.14284.pdf,"Weijia Wu, Zhuang Li, Yefei He, Mike Zheng Shou, Chunhua Shen, Lele Cheng, Yan Li, Tingting Gao, Di Zhang",cs.CV
PLUM: Improving Inference Efficiency By Leveraging Repetition-Sparsity Trade-Off,"Efficient inference of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices is essential. Quantization and sparsity are key techniques that translate to repetition and sparsity within tensors at the hardware-software interface. This paper introduces the concept of repetition-sparsity trade-off that helps explain computational efficiency during inference. We propose PLUM, a unified co-design framework that integrates DNN inference systems and quantization (forward and backward pass) to leverage the repetition-sparsity trade-off to improve inference efficiency. Our results demonstrate that PLUM's quantization method is more accurate than binary quantization with the same number of non-zero weights. Detailed analysis indicates that signed binarization generates a smaller distribution of effectual (non-zero) parameters nested within a larger distribution of total parameters of latent full-precision weights for a DNN block. Finally, the proposed PLUM framework achieves a 26% speedup on real hardware, doubles energy efficiency, and reduces density by 2.8x compared to binary methods while retaining top-1 accuracy when compared to prior-art methods for ResNets on ImageNet (by achieving 66.2% top-1 accuracy), presenting an alternative solution for deploying efficient models in resource-limited environments.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.01581.pdf,"Sachit Kuhar, Yash Jain, Alexey Tumanov",cs.LG
The Adaptive Arms Race: Redefining Robustness in AI Security,"Despite considerable efforts on making them robust, real-world AI-based systems remain vulnerable to decision based attacks, as definitive proofs of their operational robustness have so far proven intractable. Canonical robustness evaluation relies on adaptive attacks, which leverage complete knowledge of the defense and are tailored to bypass it. This work broadens the notion of adaptivity, which we employ to enhance both attacks and defenses, showing how they can benefit from mutual learning through interaction. We introduce a framework for adaptively optimizing black-box attacks and defenses under the competitive game they form. To assess robustness reliably, it is essential to evaluate against realistic and worst-case attacks. We thus enhance attacks and their evasive arsenal together using RL, apply the same principle to defenses, and evaluate them first independently and then jointly under a multi-agent perspective. We find that active defenses, those that dynamically control system responses, are an essential complement to model hardening against decision-based attacks; that these defenses can be circumvented by adaptive attacks, something that elicits defenses being adaptive too. Our findings, supported by an extensive theoretical and empirical investigation, confirm that adaptive adversaries pose a serious threat to black-box AI-based systems, rekindling the proverbial arms race. Notably, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art black-box attacks and defenses, while bringing them together to render effective insights into the robustness of real-world deployed ML-based systems.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.13435.pdf,"Ilias Tsingenopoulos, Vera Rimmer, Davy Preuveneers, Fabio Pierazzi, Lorenzo Cavallaro, Wouter Joosen",cs.AI
An Unfitted Interface Penalty DG--FE Method for Elliptic Interface Problems,"We propose an unfitted interface penalty Discontinuous Galerkin-Finite Element Method (UIPDG-FEM) for elliptic interface problems. This hybrid method combines the interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (IPDG) terms near the interface-enforcing jump conditions via Nitsche method-with standard finite elements away from the interface. The UIPDG-FEM retains the flexibilities of IPDG, particularly simplifying mesh generation around complex interfaces, while avoiding its drawback of excessive number of global degrees of freedom. We derive optimal convergence rates independent of interface location and establish uniform flux error estimates robust to discontinuous coefficients. To deal with conditioning issues caused by small cut elements, we develop a robust two-dimensional merging algorithm that eliminates such elements entirely, ensuring the condition number of the discretized system remains independent of interface position. A key feature of the algorithm is a novel quantification criterion linking the threshold for small cuts to the product of the maximum interface curvature and the local mesh size. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15402.pdf,"Juan Han, Haijun Wu, Yuanming Xiao",math.NA
Effective backdoor attack on graph neural networks in link prediction tasks,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a class of deep learning models capable of processing graph-structured data, and they have demonstrated significant performance in a variety of real-world applications. Recent studies have found that GNN models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. When specific patterns (called backdoor triggers, e.g., subgraphs, nodes, etc.) appear in the input data, the backdoor embedded in the GNN models is activated, which misclassifies the input data into the target class label specified by the attacker, whereas when there are no backdoor triggers in the input, the backdoor embedded in the GNN models is not activated, and the models work normally. Backdoor attacks are highly stealthy and expose GNN models to serious security risks. Currently, research on backdoor attacks against GNNs mainly focus on tasks such as graph classification and node classification, and backdoor attacks against link prediction tasks are rarely studied. In this paper, we propose a backdoor attack against the link prediction tasks based on GNNs and reveal the existence of such security vulnerability in GNN models, which make the backdoored GNN models to incorrectly predict unlinked two nodes as having a link relationship when a trigger appear. The method uses a single node as the trigger and poison selected node pairs in the training graph, and then the backdoor will be embedded in the GNN models through the training process. In the inference stage, the backdoor in the GNN models can be activated by simply linking the trigger node to the two end nodes of the unlinked node pairs in the input data, causing the GNN models to produce incorrect link prediction results for the target node pairs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02663.pdf,"Jiazhu Dai, Haoyu Sun",cs.LG
Simulation-Based Equations for Propagation Constant in Uniform or Periodic Transmission,"In this work, simulation-based equations to calculate propagation constant in uniform or periodic structures (SES) are deduced and verified through simulations in various types of structures. The modeling of those structures are essentially based on field distributions from a driven-mode solver, and the field distributions are used as the input parameters of the FPPS. It allows the separation of forward and backward waves from a total wave inside such a uniform or periodic structure, and thus it can be used to calculate the propagation constants inside both uniform and periodic structures even with a strong reflection. In order to test the performance and function of the FPPS, it has been applied to a variety of typical structures, including uniform waveguides, lossfree closed structures, lossy closed structures, and open radiation structures, and compared with the results of eigenmode solvers, equivalent network methods, and spectral domain integral equation methods. The comparison shows the easy-to-use and adaptable nature of the FPPS. the FPPS. This FPPS could be also applied to open radiating structures, and even multi-dimensional periodic/uniform structures.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06165.pdf,"Yifan Yin, Bingjie Zhang, Ke Wu",cs.CE
Momentum-SAM: Sharpness Aware Minimization without Computational Overhead,"The recently proposed optimization algorithm for deep neural networks Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) suggests perturbing parameters before gradient calculation by a gradient ascent step to guide the optimization into parameter space regions of flat loss. While significant generalization improvements and thus reduction of overfitting could be demonstrated, the computational costs are doubled due to the additionally needed gradient calculation, making SAM unfeasible in case of limited computationally capacities. Motivated by Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) we propose Momentum-SAM (MSAM), which perturbs parameters in the direction of the accumulated momentum vector to achieve low sharpness without significant computational overhead or memory demands over SGD or Adam. We evaluate MSAM in detail and reveal insights on separable mechanisms of NAG, SAM and MSAM regarding training optimization and generalization.

Incoherent Probability Judgments in Large Language Models,"Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) trained for next-word prediction have demonstrated remarkable proficiency at producing coherent text. But are they equally adept at forming coherent probability judgments? We use probabilistic identities and repeated judgments to assess the coherence of probability judgments made by LLMs. Our results show that the judgments produced by these models are often incoherent, displaying human-like systematic deviations from the rules of probability theory. Moreover, when prompted to judge the same event, the mean-variance relationship of probability judgments produced by LLMs shows an inverted-U-shaped like that seen in humans. We propose that these deviations from rationality can be explained by linking autoregressive LLMs to implicit Bayesian inference and drawing parallels with the Bayesian Sampler model of human probability judgments.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16646.pdf,"Jian-Qiao Zhu, Thomas L.

Perspectives on locally weighted ensemble Kalman methods,"This manuscript derives locally weighted ensemble Kalman methods from the point of view of ensemble-based function approximation. This is done by using pointwise evaluations to build up a local linear or quadratic approximation of a function, tapering off the effect of distant particles via local weighting. This introduces a candidate method (the locally weighted Ensemble Kalman method for inversion) with the motivation of combining some of the strengths of the particle filter (ability to cope with nonlinear maps and non-Gaussian distributions) and the Ensemble Kalman filter (no filter degeneracy). We provide some numerical evidence for the accuracy of locally weighted ensemble methods, both in terms of approximation and inversion.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00027.pdf,Philipp Wacker,math.NA
FreDF: Learning to Forecast in the Frequency Domain,"Time series modeling presents unique challenges due to autocorrelation in both historical data and future sequences. While current research predominantly addresses autocorrelation within historical data, the correlations among future labels are often overlooked. Specifically, modern forecasting models primarily adhere to the Direct Forecast (DF) paradigm, generating multi-step forecasts independently and disregarding label autocorrelation over time. In this work, we demonstrate that the learning objective of DF is biased in the presence of label autocorrelation. To address this issue, we propose the Frequency-enhanced Direct Forecast (FreDF), which mitigates label autocorrelation by learning to forecast in the frequency domain, thereby reducing estimation bias. Our experiments show that FreDF significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and is compatible with a variety of forecast models.

TinyCL: An Efficient Hardware Architecture for Continual Learning on Autonomous Systems,"The Continuous Learning (CL) paradigm consists of continuously evolving the parameters of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to progressively learn to perform new tasks without reducing the performance on previous tasks, i.e., avoiding the so-called catastrophic forgetting. However, the DNN parameter update in CL-based autonomous systems is extremely resource-hungry. The existing DNN accelerators cannot be directly employed in CL because they only support the execution of the forward propagation. Only a few prior architectures execute the backpropagation and weight update, but they lack the control and management for CL. Towards this, we design a hardware architecture, TinyCL, to perform CL on resource-constrained autonomous systems. It consists of a processing unit that executes both forward and backward propagation, and a control unit that manages memory-based CL workload. To minimize the memory accesses, the sliding window of the convolutional layer moves in a snake-like fashion. Moreover, the Multiply-and-Accumulate units can be reconfigured at runtime to execute different operations. As per our knowledge, our proposed TinyCL represents the first hardware accelerator that executes CL on autonomous systems. We synthesize the complete TinyCL architecture in a 65 nm CMOS technology node with the conventional ASIC design flow. It executes 1 epoch of training on a Conv + ReLU + Dense model on the CIFAR10 dataset in 1.76 s, while 1 training epoch of the same model using an Nvidia Tesla P100 GPU takes 103 s, thus achieving a 58x speedup, consuming 86 mW in a 4.74 mm2 die.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09780.pdf,"Eugenio Ressa, Alberto Marchisio, Maurizio Martina, Guido Masera, Muhammad Shafique",cs.LG
Invertible Fourier Neural Operators for Tackling Both Forward and Inverse Problems,"Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) is a powerful and popular operator learning method. However, FNO is mainly used in forward prediction, yet a great many applications rely on solving inverse problems. In this paper, we propose an invertible Fourier Neural Operator (iFNO) for jointly tackling the forward and inverse problems. We developed a series of invertible Fourier blocks in the latent channel space to share the model parameters, exchange the information, and mutually regularize the learning for the bi-directional tasks. We integrated a variational auto-encoder to capture the intrinsic structures within the input space and to enable posterior inference so as to mitigate challenges of illposedness, data shortage, noises that are common in inverse problems. We proposed a three-step process to combine the invertible blocks and the VAE component for effective training. The evaluations on seven benchmark forward and inverse tasks have demonstrated the advantages of our approach.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11722.pdf,"Da Long, Zhitong Xu, Qiwei Yuan, Yin Yang, Shandian Zhe",cs.LG
A sparse hierarchical $hp$-finite element method on disks and annuli,"We develop a sparse hierarchical $hp$-finite element method ($hp$-FEM) for the Helmholtz equation with variable coefficients posed on a two-dimensional disk or annulus. The mesh is an inner disk cell (omitted if on an annulus domain) and concentric annuli cells. The discretization preserves the Fourier mode decoupling of rotationally invariant operators, such as the Laplacian, which manifests as block diagonal mass and stiffness matrices. Moreover, the matrices have a sparsity pattern independent of the order of the discretization and admit an optimal complexity factorization. The sparse $hp$-FEM can handle radial discontinuities in the right-hand side and in rotationally invariant Helmholtz coefficients. Rotationally anisotropic coefficients that are approximated by low-degree polynomials in Cartesian coordinates also result in sparse linear systems. We consider examples such as a high-frequency Helmholtz equation with radial discontinuities and rotationally anisotropic coefficients, singular source terms, the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation, and an extension to a three-dimensional cylinder domain, with a quasi-optimal solve, via the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) algorithm.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12831.pdf,"Ioannis P.

This method is expected to enhance interpretability by integrating human insights into robustness and to accelerate practical applications. Furthermore, we mathematically verify the robustness of I-OT and discuss how these robustness properties relate to real-world applications. The effectiveness of this method is validated through a logistics simulation using automotive parts data.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17967.pdf,"Koshi Oishi, Yota Hashizume, Tomohiko Jimbo, Hirotaka Kaji, Kenji Kashima",cs.LG
Quantifying the Aggregate Flexibility of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations for Market-based Congestion Management Services,"Electric vehicles (EVs) play a crucial role in the transition towards sustainable modes of transportation and thus are critical to the energy transition. As their number grows, managing the aggregate power of EV charging is crucial to maintain grid stability and mitigate congestion. This study analyses more than 500 thousand real charging transactions in the Netherlands to explore the challenge and opportunity for the energy system presented by EV growth and smart charging flexibility. Specifically, it analyses the collective ability to provide congestion management services according to the specifications of those services in the Netherlands. In this study, a data-driven model of charging behaviour is created to explore the implications of delivering dependable congestion management services at various aggregation levels and types of service. The probabilistic ability to offer different flexibility products, namely, redispatch and capacity limitation, for congestion management, is assessed for different categories of charging stations (CS) and dispatch strategies. These probabilities can help EV aggregators, such as charging point operators, make informed decisions about offering congestion mitigation products per relevant regulations and distribution system operators to assess their potential. Further, it is shown how machine learning models can be incorporated to predict the day-ahead consumption, followed by operationally predicting redispatch flexibility. The findings demonstrate that the timing of EV arrivals, departures, and connections plays a crucial role in determining the feasibility of product offerings, and dependable services can generally be delivered using a sufficiently large number of CSs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13367.pdf,"Nanda Kishor Panda, Simon H.

A Survey on Self-Supervised Graph Foundation Models: Knowledge-Based Perspective,"Graph self-supervised learning (SSL) is now a go-to method for pre-training graph foundation models (GFMs). There is a wide variety of knowledge patterns embedded in the graph data, such as node properties and clusters, which are crucial to learning generalized representations for GFMs. However, existing surveys of GFMs have several shortcomings: they lack comprehensiveness regarding the most recent progress, have unclear categorization of self-supervised methods, and take a limited architecture-based perspective that is restricted to only certain types of graph models. As the ultimate goal of GFMs is to learn generalized graph knowledge, we provide a comprehensive survey of self-supervised GFMs from a novel knowledge-based perspective. We propose a knowledge-based taxonomy, which categorizes self-supervised graph models by the specific graph knowledge utilized. Our taxonomy consists of microscopic (nodes, links, etc.), mesoscopic (context, clusters, etc.), and macroscopic knowledge (global structure, manifolds, etc.). It covers a total of 9 knowledge categories and more than 25 pretext tasks for pre-training GFMs, as well as various downstream task generalization strategies.

FGAIF: Aligning Large Vision-Language Models with Fine-grained AI Feedback,"Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in tackling a variety of visual-language tasks. However, current LVLMs suffer from misalignment between text and image modalities which causes three kinds of hallucination problems, i.e., object existence, object attribute, and object relationship. To tackle this issue, existing methods mainly utilize Reinforcement Learning (RL) to align modalities in LVLMs. However, they still suffer from three main limitations: (1) General feedback can not indicate the hallucination type contained in the response; (2) Sparse rewards only give the sequence-level reward for the whole response; and (3)Annotation cost is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To handle these limitations, we propose an innovative method to align modalities in LVLMs through Fine-Grained Artificial Intelligence Feedback (FGAIF), which mainly consists of three steps: AI-based Feedback Collection, Fine-grained Reward Model Training, and Reinforcement Learning with Fine-grained Reward. Specifically, We first utilize AI tools to predict the types of hallucination for each segment in the response and obtain a collection of fine-grained feedback. Then, based on the collected reward data, three specialized reward models are trained to produce dense rewards. Finally, a novel fine-grained feedback module is integrated into the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted on hallucination and general benchmarks, demonstrating the superior performance of our proposed method. Notably, compared with previous models trained with the RL-based aligning method, our proposed method is effective even with fewer parameters.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05046.pdf,"Liqiang Jing, Xinya Du",cs.CV

"A Comprehensive Tutorial and Survey of O-RAN: Exploring Slicing-aware Architecture, Deployment Options, Use Cases, and Challenges","Open-radio access network (O-RAN) seeks to establish the principles of openness, programmability, automation, intelligence, and hardware-software disaggregation with interoperable and standard-compliant interfaces. It advocates for multi-vendorism and multi-stakeholderism within a cloudified and virtualized wireless infrastructure, aimed at enhancing the deployment, operation, and management of RAN architecture. These enhancements promise increased flexibility, performance optimization, service innovation, energy efficiency, and cost effectiveness across fifth-generation (5G), sixth-generation (6G), and beyond networks. A silent feature of O-RAN architecture is its support for network slicing, which entails interaction with other domains of the cellular network, notably the transport network (TN) and the core network (CN), to realize end-to-end (E2E) network slicing. The study of this feature requires exploring the stances and contributions of diverse standards development organizations (SDOs). In this context, we note that despite the ongoing industrial deployments and standardization efforts, the research and standardization communities have yet to comprehensively address network slicing in O-RAN. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive exploration of network slicing in O-RAN through an in-depth review of specification documents from O-RAN Alliance and research papers from leading industry and academic institutions.

To Ask or Not To Ask: Human-in-the-loop Contextual Bandits with Applications in Robot-Assisted Feeding,"Robot-assisted bite acquisition involves picking up food items with varying shapes, compliance, sizes, and textures. Fully autonomous strategies may not generalize efficiently across this diversity. We propose leveraging feedback from the care recipient when encountering novel food items. However, frequent queries impose a workload on the user. We formulate human-in-the-loop bite acquisition within a contextual bandit framework and introduce LinUCB-QG, a method that selectively asks for help using a predictive model of querying workload based on query types and timings. This model is trained on data collected in an online study involving 14 participants with mobility limitations, 3 occupational therapists simulating physical limitations, and 89 participants without limitations. We demonstrate that our method better balances task performance and querying workload compared to autonomous and always-querying baselines and adjusts its querying behavior to account for higher workload in users with mobility limitations.

With this loss, we can effectively control the model's smoothness and sensitivity, potentially offering the dual benefits of improving the model's generalization performance and enhancing its noise resistance on specific features. Additionally, we proposed a training method that successfully addresses the challenges in practical applications. We conducted preliminary experiments using publicly available datasets from Kaggle, demonstrating that the design of Lai loss can control the model's smoothness and sensitivity while maintaining stable model performance.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07884.pdf,YuFei Lai,cs.LG
OAC: Output-adaptive Calibration for Accurate Post-training Quantization,"Deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has major computational costs, due to their rapidly expanding size. Compression of LLMs reduces the memory footprint, latency, and energy required for their inference. Post-training Quantization (PTQ) techniques have been developed to compress LLMs while avoiding expensive re-training. Most PTQ approaches formulate the quantization error based on a layer-wise Euclidean loss, ignoring the model output. Then, each layer is calibrated using its layer-wise Hessian to update the weights towards minimizing the quantization error. The Hessian is also used for detecting the most salient weights to quantization. Such PTQ approaches are prone to accuracy drop in low-precision quantization. We propose Output-adaptive Calibration (OAC) to incorporate the model output in the calibration process. We formulate the quantization error based on the distortion of the output cross-entropy loss. OAC approximates the output-adaptive Hessian for each layer under reasonable assumptions to reduce the computational complexity. The output-adaptive Hessians are used to update the weight matrices and detect the salient weights towards maintaining the model output. Our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines such as SpQR and BiLLM, especially, at extreme low-precision (2-bit and binary) quantization.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15025.pdf,"Ali Edalati, Alireza Ghaffari, Mahsa Ghazvini Nejad, Lu Hou, Boxing Chen, Masoud Asgharian, Vahid Partovi Nia",cs.LG
HINT: Hypernetwork Approach to Training Weight Interval Regions in Continual Learning,"Recently, a new Continual Learning (CL) paradigm was presented to control catastrophic forgetting, called Interval Continual Learning (InterContiNet), which relies on enforcing interval constraints on the neural network parameter space. Unfortunately, InterContiNet training is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the weight space, making intervals difficult to manage. To address this issue, we introduce HINT, a technique that employs interval arithmetic within the embedding space and utilizes a hypernetwork to map these intervals to the target network parameter space. We train interval embeddings for consecutive tasks and train a hypernetwork to transform these embeddings into weights of the target network. An embedding for a given task is trained along with the hypernetwork, preserving the response of the target network for the previous task embeddings. Interval arithmetic works with a more manageable, lower-dimensional embedding space rather than directly preparing intervals in a high-dimensional weight space. Our model allows faster and more efficient training. Furthermore, HINT maintains the guarantee of not forgetting. At the end of training, we can choose one universal embedding to produce a single network dedicated to all tasks. In such a framework, hypernetwork is used only for training and, finally, we can utilize one set of weights. HINT obtains significantly better results than InterContiNet and gives SOTA results on several benchmarks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15444.pdf,"Patryk Krukowski, Anna Bielawska, Kamil Ksi\k{a}\.zek, Pawe{\l} Wawrzy\'nski, Pawe{\l} Batorski, Przemys{\l}aw Spurek",cs.LG

Sensor-Based Distributionally Robust Control for Safe Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments,"We introduce a novel method for mobile robot navigation in dynamic, unknown environments, leveraging onboard sensing and distributionally robust optimization to impose probabilistic safety constraints. Our method introduces a distributionally robust control barrier function (DR-CBF) that directly integrates noisy sensor measurements and state estimates to define safety constraints. This approach is applicable to a wide range of control-affine dynamics, generalizable to robots with complex geometries, and capable of operating at real-time control frequencies. Coupled with a control Lyapunov function (CLF) for path following, the proposed CLF-DR-CBF control synthesis method achieves safe, robust, and efficient navigation in challenging environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach for safe autonomous navigation under uncertainty in simulations and real-world experiments with differential-drive robots.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18251.pdf,"Kehan Long, Yinzhuang Yi, Zhirui Dai, Sylvia Herbert, Jorge Cort\'es, Nikolay Atanasov",cs.RO
Language Models Trained to do Arithmetic Predict Human Risky and Intertemporal Choice,"The observed similarities in the behavior of humans and Large Language Models (LLMs) have prompted researchers to consider the potential of using LLMs as models of human cognition. However, several significant challenges must be addressed before LLMs can be legitimately regarded as cognitive models. For instance, LLMs are trained on far more data than humans typically encounter, and may have been directly trained on human data in specific cognitive tasks or aligned with human preferences. Consequently, the origins of these behavioral similarities are not well understood. In this paper, we propose a novel way to enhance the utility of LLMs as cognitive models. This approach involves (i) leveraging computationally equivalent tasks that both an LLM and a rational agent need to master for solving a cognitive problem and (ii) examining the specific task distributions required for an LLM to exhibit human-like behaviors. We apply this approach to decision-making -- specifically risky and intertemporal choice -- where the key computationally equivalent task is the arithmetic of expected value calculations. We show that an LLM pretrained on an ecologically valid arithmetic dataset, which we call Arithmetic-GPT, predicts human behavior better than many traditional cognitive models. Pretraining LLMs on ecologically valid arithmetic datasets is sufficient to produce a strong correspondence between these models and human decision-making. Our results also suggest that LLMs used as cognitive models should be carefully investigated via ablation studies of the pretraining data.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.19313.pdf,"Jian-Qiao Zhu, Haijiang Yan, Thomas L.

Beyond Bare Queries: Open-Vocabulary Object Grounding with 3D Scene Graph,"Locating objects described in natural language presents a significant challenge for autonomous agents. Existing CLIP-based open-vocabulary methods successfully perform 3D object grounding with simple (bare) queries, but cannot cope with ambiguous descriptions that demand an understanding of object relations. To tackle this problem, we propose a modular approach called BBQ (Beyond Bare Queries), which constructs 3D scene graph representation with metric and semantic spatial edges and utilizes a large language model as a human-to-agent interface through our deductive scene reasoning algorithm. BBQ employs robust DINO-powered associations to construct 3D object-centric map and an advanced raycasting algorithm with a 2D vision-language model to describe them as graph nodes. On the Replica and ScanNet datasets, we have demonstrated that BBQ takes a leading place in open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation compared to other zero-shot methods. Also, we show that leveraging spatial relations is especially effective for scenes containing multiple entities of the same semantic class. On challenging Sr3D+, Nr3D and ScanRefer benchmarks, our deductive approach demonstrates a significant improvement, enabling objects grounding by complex queries compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The combination of our design choices and software implementation has resulted in significant data processing speed in experiments on the robot on-board computer. This promising performance enables the application of our approach in intelligent robotics projects. We made the code publicly available at https://linukc.github.io/BeyondBareQueries/.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.07113.pdf,"Sergey Linok, Tatiana Zemskova, Svetlana Ladanova, Roman Titkov, Dmitry Yudin, Maxim Monastyrny, Aleksei Valenkov",cs.CV
CombAlign: Enhancing Model Expressiveness in Unsupervised Graph Alignment,"Unsupervised graph alignment finds the node correspondence between a pair of attributed graphs by only exploiting graph structure and node features. One category of recent studies first computes the node representation and then matches nodes with the largest embedding-based similarity, while the other category reduces the problem to optimal transport (OT) via Gromov-Wasserstein learning. However, it remains largely unexplored in the model expressiveness, as well as how theoretical expressivity impacts prediction accuracy. We investigate the model expressiveness from two aspects. First, we characterize the model's discriminative power in distinguishing matched and unmatched node pairs across two graphs. Second, we study the model's capability of guaranteeing node matching properties such as one-to-one matching and mutual alignment. Motivated by our theoretical analysis, we put forward a hybrid approach named CombAlign with stronger expressive power. Specifically, we enable cross-dimensional feature interaction for OT-based learning and propose an embedding-based method inspired by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test. We also apply non-uniform marginals obtained from the embedding-based modules to OT as priors for more expressiveness. Based on that, we propose a traditional algorithm-based refinement, which combines our OT and embedding-based predictions using the ensemble learning strategy and reduces the problem to maximum weight matching. With carefully designed edge weights, we ensure those matching properties and further enhance prediction accuracy. By extensive experiments, we demonstrate a significant improvement of 14.5% in alignment accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches and confirm the soundness of our theoretical analysis.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.13216.pdf,"Songyang Chen, Yu Liu, Lei Zou, Zexuan Wang, Youfang Lin",cs.LG
SMORE: Simultaneous Map and Object REconstruction,"We present a method for dynamic surface reconstruction of large-scale urban scenes from LiDAR. Depth-based reconstructions tend to focus on small-scale objects or large-scale SLAM reconstructions that treat moving objects as outliers. We take a holistic perspective and optimize a compositional model of a dynamic scene that decomposes the world into rigidly-moving objects and the background. To achieve this, we take inspiration from recent novel view synthesis methods and frame the reconstruction problem as a global optimization over neural surfaces, ego poses, and object poses, which minimizes the error between composed spacetime surfaces and input LiDAR scans. In contrast to view synthesis methods, which typically minimize 2D errors with gradient descent, we minimize a 3D point-to-surface error by coordinate descent, which we decompose into registration and surface reconstruction steps. Each step can be handled well by off-the-shelf methods without any re-training. We analyze the surface reconstruction step for rolling-shutter LiDARs, and show that deskewing operations common in continuous time SLAM can be applied to dynamic objects as well, improving results over prior art by an order of magnitude. Beyond pursuing dynamic reconstruction as a goal in and of itself, we propose that such a system can be used to auto-label partially annotated sequences and produce ground truth annotation for hard-to-label problems such as depth completion and scene flow.

LLaSA: A Multimodal LLM for Human Activity Analysis Through Wearable and Smartphone Sensors,"Wearables generate rich motion data, yet current systems only classify what happened - failing to support natural questions about why it happened or what it means. We introduce LLaSA (Large Language and Sensor Assistant), a compact 13B model that enables ask-anything, open-ended question answering grounded in raw IMU data. LLaSA supports conversational, context-aware reasoning - explaining the causes of sensor-detected behaviors and answering free-form questions in real-world scenarios. It is tuned for scientific accuracy, coherence, and response reliability. To advance this new task of sensor-based QA, we release three large-scale datasets: SensorCaps, OpenSQA, and Tune-OpenSQA. Together, these resources define a new benchmark for sensor-language models.

Despite recent advancements, there lacks a comprehensive benchmark for AudioLLMs on instruction following capabilities conditioned on audio signals. AudioBench addresses this gap by setting up datasets as well as desired evaluation metrics. Besides, we also evaluated the capabilities of five popular models and found that no single model excels consistently across all tasks. We outline the research outlook for AudioLLMs and anticipate that our open-sourced evaluation toolkit, data, and leaderboard will offer a robust testbed for future model developments.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16020.pdf,"Bin Wang, Xunlong Zou, Geyu Lin, Shuo Sun, Zhuohan Liu, Wenyu Zhang, Zhengyuan Liu, AiTi Aw, Nancy F.

High-order Adaptive Rank Integrators for Multi-scale Linear Kinetic Transport Equations in the Hierarchical Tucker Format,"In this paper, we present a new adaptive rank approximation technique for computing solutions to the high-dimensional linear kinetic transport equation. The approach we propose is based on a macro-micro decomposition of the kinetic model in which the angular domain is discretized with a tensor product quadrature rule under the discrete ordinates method. To address the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, the proposed low-rank method is cast in the framework of the hierarchical Tucker decomposition. The adaptive rank integrators we propose are built upon high-order discretizations for both time and space. In particular, this work considers implicit-explicit discretizations for time and finite-difference weighted-essentially non-oscillatory discretizations for space. The high-order singular value decomposition is used to perform low-rank truncation of the high-dimensional time-dependent distribution function. The methods are applied to several benchmark problems, where we compare the solution quality and measure compression achieved by the adaptive rank methods against their corresponding full-grid methods. We also demonstrate the benefits of high-order discretizations in the proposed low-rank framework.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19479.pdf,"William A. Sands, Wei Guo, Jing-Mei Qiu, Tao Xiong",math.NA
Tailored Design of Audio-Visual Speech Recognition Models using Branchformers,"Recent advances in Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) have led to unprecedented achievements in the field, improving the robustness of this type of system in adverse, noisy environments. In most cases, this task has been addressed through the design of models composed of two independent encoders, each dedicated to a specific modality. However, while recent works have explored unified audio-visual encoders, determining the optimal cross-modal architecture remains an ongoing challenge. Furthermore, such approaches often rely on models comprising vast amounts of parameters and high computational cost training processes. In this paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing a novel audio-visual framework. Our proposed method constitutes, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to harness the flexibility and interpretability offered by encoder architectures, such as the Branchformer, in the design of parameter-efficient AVSR systems. To be more precise, the proposed framework consists of two steps: first, estimating audio- and video-only systems, and then designing a tailored audio-visual unified encoder based on the layer-level branch scores provided by the modality-specific models. Extensive experiments on English and Spanish AVSR benchmarks covering multiple data conditions and scenarios demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method. Even when trained on a moderate scale of data, our models achieve competitive word error rates (WER) of approximately 2.5\% for English and surpass existing approaches for Spanish, establishing a new benchmark with an average WER of around 9.1\%. These results reflect how our tailored AVSR system is able to reach state-of-the-art recognition rates while significantly reducing the model complexity w.r.t. the prevalent approach in the field.

TTT: A Temporal Refinement Heuristic for Tenuously Tractable Discrete Time Reachability Problems,"Reachable set computation is an important tool for analyzing control systems. Simulating a control system can show general trends, but a formal tool like reachability analysis can provide guarantees of correctness. Reachability analysis for complex control systems, e.g., with nonlinear dynamics and/or a neural network controller, is often either slow or overly conservative. To address these challenges, much literature has focused on spatial refinement, i.e., tuning the discretization of the input sets and intermediate reachable sets. This paper introduces the idea of temporal refinement: automatically choosing when along the horizon of the reachability problem to execute slow symbolic queries which incur less approximation error versus fast concrete queries which incur more approximation error. Temporal refinement can be combined with other refinement approaches as an additional tool to trade off tractability and tightness in approximate reachable set computation. We introduce a temporal refinement algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness at computing approximate reachable sets for nonlinear systems with neural network controllers. We calculate reachable sets with varying computational budget and show that our algorithm can generate approximate reachable sets with a similar amount of error to the baseline in 20-70% less time.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.14394.pdf,"Chelsea Sidrane, Jana Tumova",eess.SY
The statistical spread of transmission outages on a fast protection time scale based on utility data,"When there is a fault, the protection system automatically removes one or more transmission lines on a fast time scale of less than one minute. The outaged lines form a pattern in the transmission network. We extract these patterns from utility outage data, determine some key statistics of these patterns, and then show how to generate new patterns consistent with these statistics. The generated patterns provide a new and easily feasible way to model the overall effect of the protection system at the scale of a large transmission system. This new generative modeling of protection is expected to contribute to simulations of disturbances in large grids so that they can better quantify the risk of blackouts. Analysis of the pattern sizes suggests an index that describes how much outages spread in the transmission network at the fast timescale.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15059.pdf,"Ian Dobson, D.

A Sharper Global Convergence Analysis for Average Reward Reinforcement Learning via an Actor-Critic Approach,"This work examines average-reward reinforcement learning with general policy parametrization. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) guarantees for this problem are either suboptimal or hindered by several challenges, including poor scalability with respect to the size of the state-action space, high iteration complexity, and dependence on knowledge of mixing times and hitting times. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-level Monte Carlo-based Natural Actor-Critic (MLMC-NAC) algorithm. Our work is the first to achieve a global convergence rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{T})$ for average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) (where $T$ is the horizon length), without requiring the knowledge of mixing and hitting times. Moreover, the convergence rate does not scale with the size of the state space, therefore even being applicable to infinite state spaces.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18878.pdf,"Swetha Ganesh, Washim Uddin Mondal, Vaneet Aggarwal",cs.LG

Bellman Unbiasedness: Tractable and Provably Efficient Distributional Reinforcement Learning with General Value Function Approximation,"Distributional reinforcement learning improves performance by capturing environmental stochasticity, but a comprehensive theoretical understanding of its effectiveness remains elusive. In addition, the intractable element of the infinite dimensionality of distributions has been overlooked. In this paper, we present a regret analysis of distributional reinforcement learning with general value function approximation in a finite episodic Markov decision process setting. We first introduce a key notion of $\textit{Bellman unbiasedness}$ which is essential for exactly learnable and provably efficient distributional updates in an online manner. Among all types of statistical functionals for representing infinite-dimensional return distributions, our theoretical results demonstrate that only moment functionals can exactly capture the statistical information. Secondly, we propose a provably efficient algorithm, $\texttt{SF-LSVI}$, that achieves a tight regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d_E H^{\frac{3}{2}}\sqrt{K})$ where $H$ is the horizon, $K$ is the number of episodes, and $d_E$ is the eluder dimension of a function class.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21260.pdf,"Taehyun Cho, Seungyub Han, Kyungjae Lee, Seokhun Ju, Dohyeong Kim, Jungwoo Lee",cs.LG
CFBench: A Comprehensive Constraints-Following Benchmark for LLMs,"The adeptness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in comprehending and following natural language instructions is critical for their deployment in sophisticated real-world applications. Existing evaluations mainly focus on fragmented constraints or narrow scenarios, but they overlook the comprehensiveness and authenticity of constraints from the user's perspective. To bridge this gap, we propose CFBench, a large-scale Comprehensive Constraints Following Benchmark for LLMs, featuring 1,000 curated samples that cover more than 200 real-life scenarios and over 50 NLP tasks. CFBench meticulously compiles constraints from real-world instructions and constructs an innovative systematic framework for constraint types, which includes 10 primary categories and over 25 subcategories, and ensures each constraint is seamlessly integrated within the instructions.

The Struggles of LLMs in Cross-lingual Code Clone Detection,"With the involvement of multiple programming languages in modern software development, cross-lingual code clone detection has gained traction within the software engineering community. Numerous studies have explored this topic, proposing various promising approaches. Inspired by the significant advances in machine learning in recent years, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated their ability to tackle various tasks, this paper revisits cross-lingual code clone detection. We evaluate the performance of five (05) LLMs and eight prompts (08) for the identification of cross-lingual code clones. Additionally, we compare these results against two baseline methods. Finally, we evaluate a pre-trained embedding model to assess the effectiveness of the generated representations for classifying clone and non-clone pairs. The studies involving LLMs and Embedding models are evaluated using two widely used cross-lingual datasets, XLCoST and CodeNet. Our results show that LLMs can achieve high F1 scores, up to 0.99, for straightforward programming examples. However, they not only perform less well on programs associated with complex programming challenges but also do not necessarily understand the meaning of ""code clones"" in a cross-lingual setting. We show that embedding models used to represent code fragments from different programming languages in the same representation space enable the training of a basic classifier that outperforms all LLMs by ~1 and ~20 percentage points on the XLCoST and CodeNet datasets, respectively. This finding suggests that, despite the apparent capabilities of LLMs, embeddings provided by embedding models offer suitable representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-lingual code clone detection.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04430.pdf,"Micheline B\'en\'edicte Moumoula, Abdoul Kader Kabore, Jacques Klein, Tegawend\'e Bissyande",cs.SE

LLM-3D Print: Large Language Models To Monitor and Control 3D Printing,"Industry 4.0 has revolutionized manufacturing by driving digitalization and shifting the paradigm toward additive manufacturing (AM). Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), a key AM technology, enables the creation of highly customized, cost-effective products with minimal material waste through layer-by-layer extrusion, posing a significant challenge to traditional subtractive methods. However, the susceptibility of material extrusion techniques to errors often requires expert intervention to detect and mitigate defects that can severely compromise product quality. While automated error detection and machine learning models exist, their generalizability across diverse 3D printer setups, firmware, and sensors is limited, and deep learning methods require extensive labeled datasets, hindering scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we present a process monitoring and control framework that leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside 3D printers to detect and address printing defects. The LLM evaluates print quality by analyzing images captured after each layer or print segment, identifying failure modes and querying the printer for relevant parameters. It then generates and executes a corrective action plan. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed framework in identifying defects by comparing it against a control group of engineers with diverse AM expertise. Our evaluation demonstrated that LLM-based agents not only accurately identify common 3D printing errors, such as inconsistent extrusion, stringing, warping, and layer adhesion, but also effectively determine the parameters causing these failures and autonomously correct them without any need for human intervention.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14307.pdf,"Yayati Jadhav, Peter Pak, Amir Barati Farimani",cs.CL

Beyond Flatland: A Geometric Take on Matching Methods for Treatment Effect Estimation,"Matching is a popular approach in causal inference to estimate treatment effects by pairing treated and control units that are most similar in terms of their covariate information. However, classic matching methods completely ignore the geometry of the data manifold, which is crucial to define a meaningful distance for matching, and struggle when covariates are noisy and high-dimensional. In this work, we propose GeoMatching, a matching method to estimate treatment effects that takes into account the intrinsic data geometry induced by existing causal mechanisms among the confounding variables. First, we learn a low-dimensional, latent Riemannian manifold that accounts for uncertainty and geometry of the original input data. Second, we estimate treatment effects via matching in the latent space based on the learned latent Riemannian metric. We provide theoretical insights and empirical results in synthetic and real-world scenarios, demonstrating that GeoMatching yields more effective treatment effect estimators, even as we increase input dimensionality, in the presence of outliers, or in semi-supervised scenarios.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05459.pdf,"Melanie F.

Rethinking Meta-Learning from a Learning Lens,"Meta-learning seeks to learn a well-generalized model initialization from training tasks to solve unseen tasks. From the ""learning to learn"" perspective, the quality of the initialization is modeled with one-step gradient decent in the inner loop. However, contrary to theoretical expectations, our empirical analysis reveals that this may expose meta-learning to underfitting. To bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation, we reconsider meta-learning from the ""Learning"" lens. We propose that the meta-learning model comprises two interrelated components: parameters for model initialization and a meta-layer for task-specific fine-tuning. These components will lead to the risks of overfitting and underfitting depending on tasks, and their solutions, fewer parameters vs. more meta-layer, are often in conflict. To address this, we aim to regulate the task information the model receives without modifying the data or model structure. Our theoretical analysis indicates that models adapted to different tasks can mutually reinforce each other, highlighting the effective information. Based on this insight, we propose TRLearner, a plug-and-play method that leverages task relation to calibrate meta-learning. It first extracts task relation matrices and then applies relation-aware consistency regularization to guide optimization. Extensive theoretical and empirical evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08474.pdf,"Jingyao Wang, Wenwen Qiang, Changwen Zheng, Hui Xiong, Gang Hua",cs.LG
Social Opinions Prediction Utilizes Fusing Dynamics Equation with LLM-based Agents,"In the context where social media emerges as a pivotal platform for social movements and shaping public opinion, accurately simulating and predicting the dynamics of user opinions is of significant importance.

This innovative approach aligns the actions and evolution of opinions in Large Language Models (LLMs) with the real-world data on social networks. The FDE-LLM devides users into two roles: opinion leaders and followers. Opinion leaders use LLM for role-playing and employ Cellular Automata(CA) to constrain opinion changes. In contrast, opinion followers are integrated into a dynamic system that combines the CA model with the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. This innovative design significantly improves the accuracy of the simulation. Our experiments utilized four real-world datasets from Weibo. The result demonstrates that the FDE-LLM significantly outperforms traditional Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) algorithms and LLM-based algorithms. Additionally, our algorithm accurately simulates the decay and recovery of opinions over time, underscoring LLMs potential to revolutionize the understanding of social media dynamics.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08717.pdf,"Junchi Yao, Hongjie Zhang, Jie Ou, Dingyi Zuo, Zheng Yang, Zhicheng Dong",cs.SI
ASHABot: An LLM-Powered Chatbot to Support the Informational Needs of Community Health Workers,"Community health workers (CHWs) provide last-mile healthcare services but face challenges due to limited medical knowledge and training. This paper describes the design, deployment, and evaluation of ASHABot, an LLM-powered, experts-in-the-loop, WhatsApp-based chatbot to address the information needs of CHWs in India. Through interviews with CHWs and their supervisors and log analysis, we examine factors affecting their engagement with ASHABot, and ASHABot's role in addressing CHWs' informational needs. We found that ASHABot provided a private channel for CHWs to ask rudimentary and sensitive questions they hesitated to ask supervisors. CHWs trusted the information they received on ASHABot and treated it as an authoritative resource. CHWs' supervisors expanded their knowledge by contributing answers to questions ASHABot failed to answer, but were concerned about demands on their workload and increased accountability. We emphasize positioning LLMs as supplemental fallible resources within the community healthcare ecosystem, instead of as replacements for supervisor support.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10913.pdf,"Pragnya Ramjee, Mehak Chhokar, Bhuvan Sachdeva, Mahendra Meena, Hamid Abdullah, Aditya Vashistha, Ruchit Nagar, Mohit Jain",cs.HC
Adversarial and Reactive Traffic Entities for Behavior-Realistic Driving Simulation: A Review,"Despite advancements in perception and planning for autonomous vehicles (AVs), validating their performance remains a significant challenge. The deployment of planning algorithms in real-world environments is often ineffective due to discrepancies between simulations and real traffic conditions. Evaluating AVs planning algorithms in simulation typically involves replaying driving logs from recorded real-world traffic. However, entities replayed from offline data are not reactive, lack the ability to respond to arbitrary AV behavior, and cannot behave in an adversarial manner to test certain properties of the driving policy. Therefore, simulation with realistic and potentially adversarial entities represents a critical task for AV planning software validation. In this work, we aim to review current research efforts in the field of traffic simulation, focusing on the application of advanced techniques for modeling realistic and adversarial behaviors of traffic entities. The objective of this work is to categorize existing approaches based on the proposed classes of traffic entity behavior and scenario behavior control. Moreover, we collect traffic datasets and examine existing traffic simulations with respect to their employed default traffic entities. Finally, we identify challenges and open questions that hold potential for future research.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14196.pdf,"Joshua Ransiek, Philipp Reis, Tobias Sch\""urmann, Eric Sax",cs.RO

This work presents a comprehensive application of convex optimization to determine fundamental bounds on time-domain waveforms. The approach is applied to arbitrarily polarized multiport antennas and arrays, demonstrating their capability in maximizing peak radiation intensity in a specified direction and time under energy constraints. This methodology allows us to consider matching, which is crucial in such applications. To highlight the generality of the approach, receiving systems are also studied on an example of finding optimal illumination for antiferromagnetic memory switching. Thanks to its efficacy, this work enables joint optimization of excitation and system parameters.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16293.pdf,"Jakub Liska, Lukas Jelinek, Miloslav Capek",cs.IT
Automating Traffic Model Enhancement with AI Research Agent,"Developing efficient traffic models is crucial for optimizing modern transportation systems. However, current modeling approaches remain labor-intensive and prone to human errors due to their dependence on manual workflows. These processes typically involve extensive literature reviews, formula tuning, and iterative testing, which often lead to inefficiencies. To address this, we propose TR-Agent, an AI-powered framework that autonomously develops and refines traffic models through a closed-loop, iterative process. We structure the research pipeline into four key stages: idea generation, theory formulation, theory evaluation, and iterative optimization, and implement TR-Agent with four corresponding modules. These modules collaborate to retrieve knowledge from external sources, generate novel hypotheses, implement and debug models, and evaluate their performance on evaluation datasets. Through iteratively feedback and refinement, TR-Agent improves both modeling efficiency and effectiveness. We validate the framework on three representative traffic models: the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for car-following behavior, the MOBIL model for lane-changing, and the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) speed-density relationship for macroscopic traffic flow modeling. Experimental results show substantial performance gains over the original models. To assess the robustness and generalizability of the improvements, we conduct additional evaluations across multiple real-world datasets, demonstrating consistent performance gains beyond the original development data. Furthermore, TR-Agent produces interpretable explanations for each improvement, enabling researchers to easily verify and extend its results. This makes TR-Agent a valuable assistant for traffic modeling refinement and a promising tool for broader applications in transportation research.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16876.pdf,"Xusen Guo, Xinxi Yang, Mingxing Peng, Hongliang Lu, Meixin Zhu, Hai Yang",cs.AI
Spatio-Temporal Metric-Semantic Mapping for Persistent Orchard Monitoring: Method and Dataset,"Monitoring orchards at the individual tree or fruit level throughout the growth season is crucial for plant phenotyping and horticultural resource optimization, such as chemical use and yield estimation. We present a 4D spatio-temporal metric-semantic mapping system that integrates multi-session measurements to track fruit growth over time. Our approach combines a LiDAR-RGB fusion module for 3D fruit localization with a 4D fruit association method leveraging positional, visual, and topology information for improved data association precision. Evaluated on real orchard data, our method achieves a 96.9% fruit counting accuracy for 1,790 apples across 60 trees, a mean fruit size estimation error of 1.1 cm, and a 23.7% improvement in 4D data association precision over baselines. We publicly release a multimodal dataset covering five fruit species across their growth seasons at https://4d-metric-semantic-mapping.org/",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19786.pdf,"Jiuzhou Lei, Ankit Prabhu, Xu Liu, Fernando Cladera, Mehrad Mortazavi, Reza Ehsani, Pratik Chaudhari, Vijay Kumar",cs.RO
Beyond Single Concept Vector: Modeling Concept Subspace in LLMs with Gaussian Distribution,"Probing learned concepts in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for understanding how semantic knowledge is encoded internally. Training linear classifiers on probing tasks is a principle approach to denote the vector of a certain concept in the representation space. However, the single vector identified for a concept varies with both data and training, making it less robust and weakening its effectiveness in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose an approach to approximate the subspace representing a specific concept. Built on linear probing classifiers, we extend the concept vectors into Gaussian Concept Subspace (GCS). We demonstrate GCS's effectiveness through measuring its faithfulness and plausibility across multiple LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Additionally, we use representation intervention tasks to showcase its efficacy in real-world applications such as emotion steering. Experimental results indicate that GCS concept vectors have the potential to balance steering performance and maintaining the fluency in natural language generation tasks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00153.pdf,"Haiyan Zhao, Heng Zhao, Bo Shen, Ali Payani, Fan Yang, Mengnan Du",cs.CL
Motion Design Principles for Accessible Video-based Learning: Addressing Cognitive Challenges for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Learners,"Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) learners face unique challenges in video-based learning due to the complex interplay between visual and auditory information in videos. Traditional approaches to making video content accessible primarily focus on captioning, but these solutions often neglect the cognitive demands of processing both visual and textual information simultaneously. This paper introduces a set of \textit{Motion} design guidelines, aimed at mitigating these cognitive challenges and improving video learning experiences for DHH learners. Through a two-phase research, we identified five key challenges, including misaligned content and visual overload. We proposed five design principles accordingly. User study with 16 DHH participants showed that improving visual-audio relevance and guiding visual attention significantly enhances the learning experience by reducing physical demand, alleviating temporal pressure, and improving learning satisfaction. Our findings highlight the potential of Motion design to transform educational content for DHH learners, and we discuss implications for inclusive video learning tools.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00196.pdf,"Si Cheng, Haocong Cheng, Suzy Su, Lu Ming, Sarah Masud, Qi Wang, Yun Huang",cs.HC
Uncertainty-aware Human Mobility Modeling and Anomaly Detection,"Given the temporal GPS coordinates from a large set of human agents, how can we model their mobility behavior toward effective anomaly (e.g. bad-actor or malicious behavior) detection without any labeled data? Human mobility and trajectory modeling have been extensively studied, showcasing varying abilities to manage complex inputs and balance performance-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we formulate anomaly detection in complex human behavior by modeling raw GPS data as a sequence of stay-point events, each characterized by spatio-temporal features, along with trips (i.e. commute) between the stay-points. Our problem formulation allows us to leverage modern sequence models for unsupervised training and anomaly detection. Notably, we equip our proposed model USTAD (for Uncertainty-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection) with aleatoric (i.e. data) uncertainty estimation to account for inherent stochasticity in certain individuals' behavior, as well as epistemic (i.e. model) uncertainty to handle data sparsity under a large variety of human behaviors. Together, aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties unlock a robust loss function as well as uncertainty-aware decision-making in anomaly scoring. Extensive experiments shows that USTAD improves anomaly detection AUCROC by 3\%-15\% over baselines in industry-scale data.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01281.pdf,"Haomin Wen, Shurui Cao, Zeeshan Rasheed, Khurram Hassan Shafique, Leman Akoglu",cs.AI
High-order regularization dealing with ill-conditioned robot localization problems,"In this work, we propose a high-order regularization method to solve the ill-conditioned problems in robot localization. Numerical solutions to robot localization problems are often unstable when the problems are ill-conditioned. A typical way to solve ill-conditioned problems is regularization, and a classical regularization method is the Tikhonov regularization. It is shown that the Tikhonov regularization is a low-order case of our method. We find that the proposed method is superior to the Tikhonov regularization in approximating some ill-conditioned inverse problems, such as some basic robot localization problems. The proposed method overcomes the over-smoothing problem in the Tikhonov regularization as it uses more than one term in the approximation of the matrix inverse, and an explanation for the over-smoothing of the Tikhonov regularization is given. Moreover, one a priori criterion, which improves the numerical stability of the ill-conditioned problem, is proposed to obtain an optimal regularization matrix. As most of the regularization solutions are biased, we also provide two bias-correction techniques for the proposed high-order regularization. The simulation and experimental results using an Ultra-Wideband sensor network in a 3D environment are discussed, demonstrating the performance of the proposed method.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01919.pdf,"Xinghua Liu, Ming Cao",cs.RO
Uncertainty-Guided Self-Questioning and Answering for Video-Language Alignment,"The development of multi-modal models has been rapidly advancing, with some demonstrating remarkable capabilities. However, annotating video-text pairs remains expensive and insufficient. Take video question answering (VideoQA) tasks as an example, human annotated questions and answers often cover only part of the video, since the corresponding text is often short and monotonous, leading to underutilization of video. To address this, we propose a Bootstrapping Video-Language Alignment framework (BoViLA), a self-training method that augments question samples during training process through LLM-based self-questioning and answering, which help model exploit video information and the internal knowledge of LLMs more thoroughly to improve modality alignment. However, low-quality self-generated questions may instead contaminate the performance, especially in the early stages of training, as we have observed in our experiments. To filter bad self-generated questions, we introduce Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) to estimate uncertainty and assess the quality of self-generated questions by evaluating the modality alignment within the context. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to explore LLM-based self-training frameworks for modality alignment. We evaluate BoViLA on five strong VideoQA benchmarks, where it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate its effectiveness and generality. Additionally, we provide extensive analyses of the self-training framework and the EDL-based uncertainty filtering mechanism. The code will be made available.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02768.pdf,"Jin Chen, Kaijing Ma, Haojian Huang, Han Fang, Hao Sun, Mehdi Hosseinzadeh, Zhe Liu",cs.CV
CounterQuill: Investigating the Potential of Human-AI Collaboration in Online Counterspeech Writing,"Online hate speech has become increasingly prevalent on social media platforms, causing harm to individuals and society. While efforts have been made to combat this issue through content moderation, the potential of user-driven counterspeech as an alternative solution remains underexplored. Existing counterspeech methods often face challenges such as fear of retaliation and skill-related barriers. To address these challenges, we introduce CounterQuill, an AI-mediated system that assists users in composing effective and empathetic counterspeech. CounterQuill provides a three-step process: (1) a learning session to help users understand hate speech and counterspeech; (2) a brainstorming session that guides users in identifying key elements of hate speech and exploring counterspeech strategies; and (3) a co-writing session that enables users to draft and refine their counterspeech with CounterQuill. We conducted a within-subjects user study with 20 participants to evaluate CounterQuill in comparison to ChatGPT. Results show that CounterQuill's guidance and collaborative writing process provided users a stronger sense of ownership over their co-authored counterspeech. Users perceived CounterQuill as a writing partner and thus were more willing to post the co-written counterspeech online compared to the one written with ChatGPT.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03032.pdf,"Xiaohan Ding, Kaike Ping, Uma Sushmitha Gunturi, Buse Carik, Sophia Stil, Lance T Wilhelm, Taufiq Daryanto, James Hawdon, Sang Won Lee, Eugenia H Rho",cs.HC
DiffSpec: Differential Testing with LLMs using Natural Language Specifications and Code Artifacts,"Differential testing can be an effective way to find bugs in software systems with multiple implementations that conform to the same specification, like compilers, network protocol parsers, or language runtimes. Specifications for such systems are often standardized in natural language documents, like Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) specifications or IETF RFC's. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in both generating tests and handling large volumes of natural language text, making them well-suited for analyzing artifacts like specification documents, bug reports, and code implementations. In this work, we leverage natural language and code artifacts to guide LLMs to generate targeted tests that highlight meaningful behavioral differences between implementations, including those corresponding to bugs. We introduce DiffSpec, a framework for generating differential tests with LLMs using prompt chaining. We demonstrate DiffSpec's efficacy on two different (extensively tested) systems, eBPF runtimes and Wasm validators. Using DiffSpec, we generated 1901 differentiating tests, uncovering at least four distinct and confirmed bugs in eBPF, including a kernel memory leak, inconsistent behavior in jump instructions, undefined behavior when using the stack pointer, and tests with infinite loops that hang the verifier in ebpf-for-windows. We also found 299 differentiating tests in Wasm validators pointing to two confirmed and fixed bugs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04249.pdf,"Nikitha Rao, Elizabeth Gilbert, Harrison Green, Tahina Ramananandro, Nikhil Swamy, Claire Le Goues, Sarah Fakhoury",cs.SE
Improving the Weighting Strategy in KernelSHAP,"In Explainable AI (XAI), Shapley values are a popular model-agnostic framework for explaining predictions made by complex machine learning models. The computation of Shapley values requires estimating non-trivial contribution functions representing predictions with only a subset of the features present. As the number of these terms grows exponentially with the number of features, computational costs escalate rapidly, creating a pressing need for efficient and accurate approximation methods. For tabular data, the KernelSHAP framework is considered the state-of-the-art model-agnostic approximation framework. KernelSHAP approximates the Shapley values using a weighted sample of the contribution functions for different feature subsets. We propose a novel modification of KernelSHAP which replaces the stochastic weights with deterministic ones to reduce the variance of the resulting Shapley value approximations. This may also be combined with our simple, yet effective modification to the KernelSHAP variant implemented in the popular Python library SHAP. Additionally, we provide an overview of established methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods can reduce the required number of contribution function evaluations by $5\%$ to $50\%$ while preserving the same accuracy of the approximated Shapley values -- essentially reducing the running time by up to $50\%$. These computational advancements push the boundaries of the feature dimensionality and number of predictions that can be accurately explained with Shapley values within a feasible runtime.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04883.pdf,"Lars Henry Berge Olsen, Martin Jullum",cs.LG
SAPIENT: Mastering Multi-turn Conversational Recommendation with Strategic Planning and Monte Carlo Tree Search,"Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) proactively engage users in interactive dialogues to elicit user preferences and provide personalized recommendations. Existing methods train Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based agent with greedy action selection or sampling strategy, and may suffer from suboptimal conversational planning. To address this, we present a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based CRS framework SAPIENT. SAPIENT consists of a conversational agent (S-agent) and a conversational planner (S-planner). S-planner builds a conversational search tree with MCTS based on the initial actions proposed by S-agent to find conversation plans. The best conversation plans from S-planner are used to guide the training of S-agent, creating a self-training loop where S-agent can iteratively improve its capability for conversational planning. Furthermore, we propose an efficient variant SAPIENT-e for trade-off between training efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that SAPIENT outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.09580.pdf,"Hanwen Du, Bo Peng, Xia Ning",cs.CL
AI-Aided Kalman Filters,"The Kalman filter (KF) and its variants are among the most celebrated algorithms in signal processing. These methods are used for state estimation of dynamic systems by relying on mathematical representations in the form of simple state-space (SS) models, which may be crude and inaccurate descriptions of the underlying dynamics. Emerging data-centric artificial intelligence (AI) techniques tackle these tasks using deep neural networks (DNNs), which are model-agnostic. Recent developments illustrate the possibility of fusing DNNs with classic Kalman-type filtering, obtaining systems that learn to track in partially known dynamics. This article provides a tutorial-style overview of design approaches for incorporating AI in aiding KF-type algorithms. We review both generic and dedicated DNN architectures suitable for state estimation, and provide a systematic presentation of techniques for fusing AI tools with KFs and for leveraging partial SS modeling and data, categorizing design approaches into task-oriented and SS model-oriented. The usefulness of each approach in preserving the individual strengths of model-based KFs and data-driven DNNs is investigated in a qualitative and quantitative study, whose code is publicly available, illustrating the gains of hybrid model-based/data-driven designs.

Local Off-Grid Weather Forecasting with Multi-Modal Earth Observation Data,"Urgent applications like wildfire management and renewable energy generation require precise, localized weather forecasts near the Earth's surface. However, forecasts produced by machine learning models or numerical weather prediction systems are typically generated on large-scale regular grids, where direct downscaling fails to capture fine-grained, near-surface weather patterns. In this work, we propose a multi-modal transformer model trained end-to-end to downscale gridded forecasts to off-grid locations of interest. Our model directly combines local historical weather observations (e.g., wind, temperature, dewpoint) with gridded forecasts to produce locally accurate predictions at various lead times. Multiple data modalities are collected and concatenated at station-level locations, treated as a token at each station. Using self-attention, the token corresponding to the target location aggregates information from its neighboring tokens. Experiments using weather stations across the Northeastern United States show that our model outperforms a range of data-driven and non-data-driven off-grid forecasting methods. They also reveal that direct input of station data provides a phase shift in local weather forecasting accuracy, reducing the prediction error by up to 80% compared to pure gridded data based models. This approach demonstrates how to bridge the gap between large-scale weather models and locally accurate forecasts to support high-stakes, location-sensitive decision-making.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12938.pdf,"Qidong Yang, Jonathan Giezendanner, Daniel Salles Civitarese, Johannes Jakubik, Eric Schmitt, Anirban Chandra, Jeremy Vila, Detlef Hohl, Chris Hill, Campbell Watson, Sherrie Wang",cs.LG

Reward-free World Models for Online Imitation Learning,"Imitation learning (IL) enables agents to acquire skills directly from expert demonstrations, providing a compelling alternative to reinforcement learning. However, prior online IL approaches struggle with complex tasks characterized by high-dimensional inputs and complex dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel approach to online imitation learning that leverages reward-free world models. Our method learns environmental dynamics entirely in latent spaces without reconstruction, enabling efficient and accurate modeling. We adopt the inverse soft-Q learning objective, reformulating the optimization process in the Q-policy space to mitigate the instability associated with traditional optimization in the reward-policy space. By employing a learned latent dynamics model and planning for control, our approach consistently achieves stable, expert-level performance in tasks with high-dimensional observation or action spaces and intricate dynamics. We evaluate our method on a diverse set of benchmarks, including DMControl, MyoSuite, and ManiSkill2, demonstrating superior empirical performance compared to existing approaches.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14081.pdf,"Shangzhe Li, Zhiao Huang, Hao Su",cs.LG
Sylvester-Preconditioned Adaptive-Rank Implicit Time Integrators for Advection-Diffusion Equations with Variable Coefficients,"We consider the adaptive-rank integration of {2D and 3D} time-dependent advection-diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs) with variable coefficients. We employ a standard finite-difference method for spatial discretization coupled with diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta temporal schemes. The discrete equation is a generalized Sylvester equation (GSE), which we solve with an adaptive-rank algorithm structured around three key strategies: {(i) constructing dimension-wise subspaces based on an extended Krylov strategy, (ii) developing an effective preconditioner for the reduced coefficient matrix, and (iii) efficiently computing the residual of the equation without explicitly reverting to the full-rank form. {The low-rank decomposition is performed in 2D using SVD, and with high-order SVD (HOSVD) in 3D to represent the tensor in a compressed Tucker format.} The computational complexity of the proposed approach {is demonstrated numerically to} be comparable to the constant-coefficient case [El Kahza et al, J.

Neural Network Matrix Product Operator: A Multi-Dimensionally Integrable Machine Learning Potential,"A neural network-based machine learning potential energy surface (PES) expressed in a matrix product operator (NN-MPO) is proposed. The MPO form enables efficient evaluation of high-dimensional integrals that arise in solving the time-dependent and time-independent Schr\""odinger equation and effectively overcomes the so-called curse of dimensionality. This starkly contrasts with other neural network-based machine learning PES methods, such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), where evaluating high-dimensional integrals is not straightforward due to the fully connected topology in their backbone architecture. Nevertheless, the NN-MPO retains the high representational capacity of neural networks. NN-MPO can achieve spectroscopic accuracy with a test mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.03 cm$^{-1}$ for a fully coupled six-dimensional ab initio PES, using only 625 training points distributed across a 0 to 17,000 cm$^{-1}$ energy range.

Personalization of Large Language Models: A Survey,"Personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently become increasingly important with a wide range of applications. Despite the importance and recent progress, most existing works on personalized LLMs have focused either entirely on (a) personalized text generation or (b) leveraging LLMs for personalization-related downstream applications, such as recommendation systems. In this work, we bridge the gap between these two separate main directions for the first time by introducing a taxonomy for personalized LLM usage and summarizing the key differences and challenges. We provide a formalization of the foundations of personalized LLMs that consolidates and expands notions of personalization of LLMs, defining and discussing novel facets of personalization, usage, and desiderata of personalized LLMs. We then unify the literature across these diverse fields and usage scenarios by proposing systematic taxonomies for the granularity of personalization, personalization techniques, datasets, evaluation methods, and applications of personalized LLMs. Finally, we highlight challenges and important open problems that remain to be addressed.

CleAR: Robust Context-Guided Generative Lighting Estimation for Mobile Augmented Reality,"High-quality environment lighting is essential for creating immersive mobile augmented reality (AR) experiences. However, achieving visually coherent estimation for mobile AR is challenging due to several key limitations in AR device sensing capabilities, including low camera FoV and limited pixel dynamic ranges. Recent advancements in generative AI, which can generate high-quality images from different types of prompts, including texts and images, present a potential solution for high-quality lighting estimation. Still, to effectively use generative image diffusion models, we must address two key limitations of content quality and slow inference. In this work, we design and implement a generative lighting estimation system called CleAR that can produce high-quality, diverse environment maps in the format of 360{\deg} HDR images. Specifically, we design a two-step generation pipeline guided by AR environment context data to ensure the output aligns with the physical environment's visual context and color appearance. To improve the estimation robustness under different lighting conditions, we design a real-time refinement component to adjust lighting estimation results on AR devices. Through a combination of quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that CleAR outperforms state-of-the-art lighting estimation methods on both estimation accuracy, latency, and robustness, and is rated by 31 participants as producing better renderings for most virtual objects. For example, CleAR achieves 51% to 56% accuracy improvement on virtual object renderings across objects of three distinctive types of materials and reflective properties. CleAR produces lighting estimates of comparable or better quality in just 3.2 seconds -- over 110X faster than state-of-the-art methods.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02179.pdf,"Yiqin Zhao, Mallesham Dasari, Tian Guo",cs.CV
Decoupling Fine Detail and Global Geometry for Compressed Depth Map Super-Resolution,"Recovering high-quality depth maps from compressed sources has gained significant attention due to the limitations of consumer-grade depth cameras and the bandwidth restrictions during data transmission. However, current methods still suffer from two challenges. First, bit-depth compression produces a uniform depth representation in regions with subtle variations, hindering the recovery of detailed information. Second, densely distributed random noise reduces the accuracy of estimating the global geometric structure of the scene. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, termed geometry-decoupled network (GDNet), for compressed depth map super-resolution that decouples the high-quality depth map reconstruction process by handling global and detailed geometric features separately. To be specific, we propose the fine geometry detail encoder (FGDE), which is designed to aggregate fine geometry details in high-resolution low-level image features while simultaneously enriching them with complementary information from low-resolution context-level image features. In addition, we develop the global geometry encoder (GGE) that aims at suppressing noise and extracting global geometric information effectively via constructing compact feature representation in a low-rank space. We conduct experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our GDNet significantly outperforms current methods in terms of geometric consistency and detail recovery. In the ECCV 2024 AIM Compressed Depth Upsampling Challenge, our solution won the 1st place award.

Precision Glass Thermoforming Assisted by Neural Networks,"Many glass products require thermoformed geometry with high precision. However, the traditional approach of developing a thermoforming process through trials and errors can cause large waste of time and resources and often end up with unsuccessfulness. Hence, there is a need to develop an efficient predictive model, replacing the costly simulations or experiments, to assist the design of precision glass thermoforming. In this work, we report a surrogate model, based on a dimensionless back-propagation neural network (BPNN), that can adequately predict the form errors and thus compensate for these errors in mold design using geometric features and process parameters as inputs. Our trials with simulation and industrial data indicate that the surrogate model can predict forming errors with adequate accuracy. Although perception errors (mold designers' decisions) and mold fabrication errors make the industrial training data less reliable than simulation data, our preliminary training and testing results still achieved a reasonable consistency with industrial data, suggesting that the surrogate models are directly implementable in the glass-manufacturing industry.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.06762.pdf,"Yuzhou Zhang, Mohan Hua, Jinan Liu, Haihui Ruan",cs.CE
Large Language Models as Robust Data Generators in Software Analytics: Are We There Yet?,"Large Language Model (LLM)-generated data is increasingly used in software analytics, but it is unclear how this data compares to human-written data, particularly when models are exposed to adversarial scenarios. Adversarial attacks can compromise the reliability and security of software systems, so understanding how LLM-generated data performs under these conditions, compared to human-written data, which serves as the benchmark for model performance, can provide valuable insights into whether LLM-generated data offers similar robustness and effectiveness. To address this gap, we systematically evaluate and compare the quality of human-written and LLM-generated data for fine-tuning robust pre-trained models (PTMs) in the context of adversarial attacks. We evaluate the robustness of six widely used PTMs, fine-tuned on human-written and LLM-generated data, before and after adversarial attacks. This evaluation employs nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) adversarial attack techniques across three popular software analytics tasks: clone detection, code summarization, and sentiment analysis in code review discussions. Additionally, we analyze the quality of the generated adversarial examples using eleven similarity metrics. Our findings reveal that while PTMs fine-tuned on LLM-generated data perform competitively with those fine-tuned on human-written data, they exhibit less robustness against adversarial attacks in software analytics tasks. Our study underscores the need for further exploration into enhancing the quality of LLM-generated training data to develop models that are both high-performing and capable of withstanding adversarial attacks in software analytics.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10565.pdf,"Md.

Online Item Cold-Start Recommendation with Popularity-Aware Meta-Learning,"With the rise of e-commerce and short videos, online recommender systems that can capture users' interests and update new items in real-time play an increasingly important role. In both online and offline recommendation systems, the cold-start problem caused by interaction sparsity has been impacting the effectiveness of recommendations for cold-start items. Many cold-start scheme based on fine-tuning or knowledge transferring shows excellent performance on offline recommendation. Yet, these schemes are infeasible for online recommendation on streaming data pipelines due to different training method, computational overhead and time constraints. Inspired by the above questions, we propose a model-agnostic recommendation algorithm called Popularity-Aware Meta-learning (PAM), to address the item cold-start problem under streaming data settings. PAM divides the incoming data into different meta-learning tasks by predefined item popularity thresholds. The model can distinguish and reweight behavior-related and content-related features in each task based on their different roles in different popularity levels, thus adapting to recommendations for cold-start samples. These task-fixing design significantly reduces additional computation and storage costs compared to offline methods. Furthermore, PAM also introduced data augmentation and an additional self-supervised loss specifically designed for low-popularity tasks, leveraging insights from high-popularity samples. This approach effectively mitigates the issue of inadequate supervision due to the scarcity of cold-start samples. Experimental results across multiple public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other baseline methods in addressing cold-start challenges in online streaming data scenarios.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11225.pdf,"Yunze Luo, Yuezihan Jiang, Yinjie Jiang, Gaode Chen, Jingchi Wang, Kaigui Bian, Peiyi Li, Qi Zhang",cs.IR
PEEK: Phishing Evolution Framework for Phishing Generation and Evolving Pattern Analysis using Large Language Models,"Phishing remains a pervasive cyber threat, as attackers craft deceptive emails to lure victims into revealing sensitive information. While Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular, deep learning, has become a key component in defending against phishing attacks, these approaches face critical limitations. The scarcity of publicly available, diverse, and updated data, largely due to privacy concerns, constrains detection effectiveness. As phishing tactics evolve rapidly, models trained on limited, outdated data struggle to detect new, sophisticated deception strategies, leaving systems and people vulnerable to an ever-growing array of attacks. We propose the first Phishing Evolution FramEworK (PEEK) for augmenting phishing email datasets with respect to quality and diversity, and analyzing changing phishing patterns for detection to adapt to updated phishing attacks. Specifically, we integrate large language models (LLMs) into the process of adversarial training to enhance the performance of the generated dataset and leverage persuasion principles in a recurrent framework to facilitate the understanding of changing phishing strategies. PEEK raises the proportion of usable phishing samples from 21.4% to 84.8%, surpassing existing works that rely on prompting and fine-tuning LLMs. The phishing datasets provided by PEEK, with evolving phishing patterns, outperform the other two available LLM-generated phishing email datasets in improving detection robustness. PEEK phishing boosts detectors' accuracy to over 88% and reduces adversarial sensitivity by up to 70%, still maintaining 70% detection accuracy against adversarial attacks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11389.pdf,"Fengchao Chen, Tingmin Wu, Van Nguyen, Shuo Wang, Alsharif Abuadbba, Carsten Rudolph",cs.CR
ACRIC: Securing Legacy Communication Networks via Authenticated Cyclic Redundancy Integrity Check,"The increasing integration of modern IT technologies into OT technologies and industrial systems is expanding the vulnerability surface of legacy infrastructures, which often rely on outdated protocols and resource-constrained devices. Recent security incidents in safety-critical industries exposed how the lack of proper message authentication enables attackers to inject malicious commands or alter system behavior, revealing fundamental security weaknesses in existing architectures. These shortcomings have thus prompted new regulations that emphasize the pressing need to strengthen cybersecurity, particularly in legacy systems. Authentication is widely recognized as a fundamental security measure that enhances system resilience. However, its adoption in legacy industrial environments is limited due to practical challenges like backward compatibility, message format changes, and hardware replacement or upgrades costs. In this paper, we introduce ACRIC, a message authentication solution to secure legacy industrial communications explicitly tailored to overcome those challenges all at once. ACRIC uniquely leverages cryptographic computations applied to the CRC field - already present in most industrial communication protocols - ensuring robust message integrity protection and authentication without requiring additional hardware or modifications to existing message formats. ACRIC's backward compatibility and protocol-agnostic nature enable coexistence with non-secured devices, thus facilitating gradual security upgrades in legacy infrastructures. Formal security assessment and experimental evaluation on an industrial-grade testbed demonstrate that ACRIC provides robust security guarantees with minimal computational overhead (~ 4 us). These results underscore ACRIC's practicality, cost-effectiveness, and suitability for effective adoption in resource-constrained industrial environments.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14394.pdf,"Alessandro Lotto, Alessandro Brighente, Mauro Conti",cs.CR
"About Time: Advances, Challenges, and Outlooks of Action Understanding","We have witnessed impressive advances in video action understanding. Increased dataset sizes, variability, and computation availability have enabled leaps in performance and task diversification. Current systems can provide coarse- and fine-grained descriptions of video scenes, extract segments corresponding to queries, synthesize unobserved parts of videos, and predict context across multiple modalities. This survey comprehensively reviews advances in uni- and multi-modal action understanding across a range of tasks. We focus on prevalent challenges, overview widely adopted datasets, and survey seminal works with an emphasis on recent advances. We broadly distinguish between three temporal scopes: (1) recognition tasks of actions observed in full, (2) prediction tasks for ongoing partially observed actions, and (3) forecasting tasks for subsequent unobserved action(s). This division allows us to identify specific action modeling and video representation challenges. Finally, we outline future directions to address current shortcomings.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15106.pdf,"Alexandros Stergiou, Ronald Poppe",cs.CV
Don't Mesh with Me: Generating Constructive Solid Geometry Instead of Meshes by Fine-Tuning a Code-Generation LLM,"While recent advancements in machine learning, such as LLMs, are revolutionizing software development and creative industries, they have had minimal impact on engineers designing mechanical parts, which remains largely a manual process. Existing approaches to generating 3D geometry most commonly use meshes as a 3D representation. While meshes are suitable for assets in video games or animations, they lack sufficient precision and adaptability for mechanical engineering purposes. This paper introduces a novel approach for the generation of 3D geometry that generates surface-based Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) by leveraging a code-generation LLM. First, we create a dataset of 3D mechanical parts represented as code scripts by converting Boundary Representation geometry (BREP) into CSG-based Python scripts. Second, we create annotations in natural language using GPT-4. The resulting dataset is used to fine-tune a code-generation LLM. The fine-tuned LLM can complete geometries based on positional input and natural language in a plausible way, demonstrating geometric understanding.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15279.pdf,"Maximilian Mews, Ansar Aynetdinov, Vivian Schiller, Peter Eisert, Alan Akbik",cs.LG
Editable-DeepSC: Reliable Cross-Modal Semantic Communications for Facial Editing,"Real-time computer vision (CV) plays a crucial role in various real-world applications, whose performance is highly dependent on communication networks. Nonetheless, the data-oriented characteristics of conventional communications often do not align with the special needs of real-time CV tasks. To alleviate this issue, the recently emerged semantic communications only transmit task-related semantic information and exhibit a promising landscape to address this problem. However, the communication challenges associated with Semantic Facial Editing, one of the most important real-time CV applications on social media, still remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing Editable-DeepSC, a novel cross-modal semantic communication approach for facial editing. Firstly, we theoretically discuss different transmission schemes that separately handle communications and editings, and emphasize the necessity of Joint Editing-Channel Coding (JECC) via iterative attributes matching, which integrates editings into the communication chain to preserve more semantic mutual information. To compactly represent the high-dimensional data, we leverage inversion methods via pre-trained StyleGAN priors for semantic coding. To tackle the dynamic channel noise conditions, we propose SNR-aware channel coding via model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments indicate that Editable-DeepSC can achieve superior editings while significantly saving the transmission bandwidth, even under high-resolution and out-of-distribution (OOD) settings.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15702.pdf,"Bin Chen, Wenbo Yu, Qinshan Zhang, Tianqu Zhuang, Yong Jiang, Shu-Tao Xia",cs.IT
Polarization under the Channel Noise with Memory,"This paper presents a comprehensive study of channel polarization under noise with memory. By introducing a genie-aided channel model, we demonstrate that polarized subchannels still converge to extremal channels under the standard polar coding structure. Notably, the proportion of near-perfect subchannels can exceed the underlying channel capacity $I(W)$. However, we also show that the polarization rate is slower than that observed in the binary-input memoryless channel (BMC) scenario. In particular, the block error probability is upper-bounded by $\mathcal{O}(L^{-c_0})$, where $L$ denotes the block length and $c_0$ is a positive constant. Moreover, we investigate both upper and lower bounds on the gap between the channel capacity and the cutoff rate under finite block length, which offers greater relevance for practical implementations.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16557.pdf,"Tianfu Qi, Jun Wang",cs.IT
AC3D: Analyzing and Improving 3D Camera Control in Video Diffusion Transformers,"Numerous works have recently integrated 3D camera control into foundational text-to-video models, but the resulting camera control is often imprecise, and video generation quality suffers. In this work, we analyze camera motion from a first principles perspective, uncovering insights that enable precise 3D camera manipulation without compromising synthesis quality. First, we determine that motion induced by camera movements in videos is low-frequency in nature. This motivates us to adjust train and test pose conditioning schedules, accelerating training convergence while improving visual and motion quality. Then, by probing the representations of an unconditional video diffusion transformer, we observe that they implicitly perform camera pose estimation under the hood, and only a sub-portion of their layers contain the camera information. This suggested us to limit the injection of camera conditioning to a subset of the architecture to prevent interference with other video features, leading to a 4x reduction of training parameters, improved training speed, and 10% higher visual quality. Finally, we complement the typical dataset for camera control learning with a curated dataset of 20K diverse, dynamic videos with stationary cameras. This helps the model distinguish between camera and scene motion and improves the dynamics of generated pose-conditioned videos. We compound these findings to design the Advanced 3D Camera Control (AC3D) architecture, the new state-of-the-art model for generative video modeling with camera control.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18673.pdf,"Sherwin Bahmani, Ivan Skorokhodov, Guocheng Qian, Aliaksandr Siarohin, Willi Menapace, Andrea Tagliasacchi, David B.

MATATA: Weakly Supervised End-to-End MAthematical Tool-Augmented Reasoning for Tabular Applications,"Business documents often contain substantial tabular and textual information with numerical values, requiring mathematical reasoning for effective document understanding. While Small Language Models (SLMs) still struggle at this task, tool-augmented multi-step agents perform better, at the cost of relying on closed-source or larger models, external data, or extensive prompt-engineering. This work introduces MATATA, a novel weakly supervised end-to-end approach to train multi-step reasoning language agents for document tabular applications. MATATA presents an annotation-free paradigm for each agent to enhance 3.8B/8B SLMs. During its two-stage training, MATATA uses the final outcome of the multi-step reasoning chain as weak supervision. This approach avoids having to individually supervise each intermediate agent in the reasoning chain. By employing an adaptive planner and shared tools across different datasets, MATATA shows robust performance. Experiments demonstrate that MATATA achieves state-of-the-art on FinQA, and on TAT-QA among reasoning methods based on open-source SLMs. Although being SLM-based, MATATA closely matches GPT-4-based frameworks on TabMWP. This novel weakly supervised approach enables training an end-to-end multi-step reasoning agent without intermediate supervision, supporting future developments of cost-effective powerful agentic systems.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18915.pdf,"Vishnou Vinayagame, Gregory Senay, Luis Mart\'i",cs.LG

FastRM: An efficient and automatic explainability framework for multimodal generative models,"Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities over textual and visual inputs. However, these models remain prone to generating misinformation. Identifying and mitigating ungrounded responses is crucial for developing trustworthy AI. Traditional explainability methods such as gradient-based relevancy maps, offer insight into the decision process of models, but are often computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time output validation. In this work, we introduce FastRM, an efficient method for predicting explainable Relevancy Maps of LVLMs. Furthermore, FastRM provides both quantitative and qualitative assessment of model confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that FastRM achieves a 99.8% reduction in computation time and a 44.4% reduction in memory footprint compared to traditional relevancy map generation. FastRM allows explainable AI to be more practical and scalable, thereby promoting its deployment in real-world applications and enabling users to more effectively evaluate the reliability of model outputs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01487.pdf,"Gabriela Ben-Melech Stan, Estelle Aflalo, Man Luo, Shachar Rosenman, Tiep Le, Sayak Paul, Shao-Yen Tseng, Vasudev Lal",cs.AI
Variable-Speed Teaching-Playback as Real-World Data Augmentation for Imitation Learning,"Because imitation learning relies on human demonstrations in hard-to-simulate settings, the inclusion of force control in this method has resulted in a shortage of training data, even with a simple change in speed. Although the field of data augmentation has addressed the lack of data, conventional methods of data augmentation for robot manipulation are limited to simulation-based methods or downsampling for position control. This paper proposes a novel method of data augmentation that is applicable to force control and preserves the advantages of real-world datasets. We applied teaching-playback at variable speeds as real-world data augmentation to increase both the quantity and quality of environmental reactions at variable speeds. An experiment was conducted on bilateral control-based imitation learning using a method of imitation learning equipped with position-force control. We evaluated the effect of real-world data augmentation on two tasks, pick-and-place and wiping, at variable speeds, each from two human demonstrations at fixed speed. The results showed a maximum 55% increase in success rate from a simple change in speed of real-world reactions and improved accuracy along the duration/frequency command by gathering environmental reactions at variable speeds.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03252.pdf,"Nozomu Masuya, Hiroshi Sato, Koki Yamane, Takuya Kusume, Sho Sakaino, Toshiaki Tsuji",cs.RO

Previous large-scale editing datasets often incorporate minimal human feedback, leading to challenges in aligning datasets with human preferences. HumanEdit bridges this gap by employing human annotators to construct data pairs and administrators to provide feedback. With meticulously curation, HumanEdit comprises 5,751 images and requires more than 2,500 hours of human effort across four stages, ensuring both accuracy and reliability for a wide range of image editing tasks. The dataset includes six distinct types of editing instructions: Action, Add, Counting, Relation, Remove, and Replace, encompassing a broad spectrum of real-world scenarios. All images in the dataset are accompanied by masks, and for a subset of the data, we ensure that the instructions are sufficiently detailed to support mask-free editing. Furthermore, HumanEdit offers comprehensive diversity and high-resolution $1024 \times 1024$ content sourced from various domains, setting a new versatile benchmark for instructional image editing datasets.

Efficient Diversity-Preserving Diffusion Alignment via Gradient-Informed GFlowNets,"While one commonly trains large diffusion models by collecting datasets on target downstream tasks, it is often desired to align and finetune pretrained diffusion models with some reward functions that are either designed by experts or learned from small-scale datasets. Existing post-training methods for reward finetuning of diffusion models typically suffer from lack of diversity in generated samples, lack of prior preservation, and/or slow convergence in finetuning. In response to this challenge, we take inspiration from recent successes in generative flow networks (GFlowNets) and propose a reinforcement learning method for diffusion model finetuning, dubbed Nabla-GFlowNet (abbreviated as $\nabla$-GFlowNet), that leverages the rich signal in reward gradients for probabilistic diffusion finetuning. We show that our proposed method achieves fast yet diversity- and prior-preserving finetuning of Stable Diffusion, a large-scale text-conditioned image diffusion model, on different realistic reward functions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07775.pdf,"Zhen Liu, Tim Z.

CK-MPM: A Compact-Kernel Material Point Method,"The Material Point Method (MPM) has become a cornerstone of physics-based simulation, widely used in geomechanics and computer graphics for modeling phenomena such as granular flows, viscoelasticity, fracture mechanics, etc. Despite its versatility, the original MPM suffers from cell-crossing instabilities caused by discontinuities in particle-grid transfer kernels. Existing solutions mostly mitigate these issues by adopting smoother shape functions, but at the cost of increased numerical diffusion and computational overhead due to larger kernel support. In this paper, we propose a novel C^2-continuous compact kernel for MPM that achieves a unique balance in terms of stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Our method integrates seamlessly with Affine Particle-In-Cell (APIC) and Moving Least Squares (MLS) MPM, while only doubling the number of grid nodes associated with each particle compared to linear kernels. At its core is an innovative dual-grid framework, which associates particles with grid nodes exclusively within the cells they occupy on two staggered grids, ensuring consistent and stable force computations. We demonstrate that our method can be conveniently implemented using a domain-specific language, Taichi, or based on open-source GPU MPM frameworks, achieving faster runtime and less numerical diffusion compared to quadratic B-spline MPM. Comprehensive validation through unit tests, comparative studies, and stress tests demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in conserving both linear and angular momentum, handling stiff materials, and scaling efficiently for large-scale simulations. Our results highlight the transformative potential of compact, high-order kernels in advancing MPM's capabilities for stable, accurate, and high-performance simulations.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10399.pdf,"Michael Liu, Xinlei Wang, Minchen Li",cs.GR
Visual-Based Forklift Learning System Enabling Zero-Shot Sim2Real Without Real-World Data,"Forklifts are used extensively in various industrial settings and are in high demand for automation. In particular, counterbalance forklifts are highly versatile and employed in diverse scenarios. However, efforts to automate these processes are lacking, primarily owing to the absence of a safe and performance-verifiable development environment. This study proposes a learning system that combines a photorealistic digital learning environment with a 1/14-scale robotic forklift environment to address this challenge. Inspired by the training-based learning approach adopted by forklift operators, we employ an end-to-end vision-based deep reinforcement learning approach. The learning is conducted in a digitalized environment created from CAD data, making it safe and eliminating the need for real-world data. In addition, we safely validate the method in a physical setting utilizing a 1/14-scale robotic forklift with a configuration similar to that of a real forklift. We achieved a 60% success rate in pallet loading tasks in real experiments using a robotic forklift. Our approach demonstrates zero-shot sim2real with a simple method that does not require heuristic additions.

Unleashing the Power of Continual Learning on Non-Centralized Devices: A Survey,"Non-Centralized Continual Learning (NCCL) has become an emerging paradigm for enabling distributed devices such as vehicles and servers to handle streaming data from a joint non-stationary environment. To achieve high reliability and scalability in deploying this paradigm in distributed systems, it is essential to conquer challenges stemming from both spatial and temporal dimensions, manifesting as distribution shifts, catastrophic forgetting, heterogeneity, and privacy issues. This survey focuses on a comprehensive examination of the development of the non-centralized continual learning algorithms and the real-world deployment across distributed devices. We begin with an introduction to the background and fundamentals of non-centralized learning and continual learning. Then, we review existing solutions from three levels to represent how existing techniques alleviate the catastrophic forgetting and distribution shift. Additionally, we delve into the various types of heterogeneity issues, security, and privacy attributes, as well as real-world applications across three prevalent scenarios.

"Gender Disparities in Contributions, Leadership, and Collaboration: An Exploratory Study on Software Systems Research","Gender diversity enhances research by bringing diverse perspectives and innovative approaches. It ensures equitable solutions that address the needs of diverse populations. However, gender disparity persists in research where women remain underrepresented, which might limit diversity and innovation. Many even leave scientific careers as their contributions often go unnoticed and undervalued. Therefore, understanding gender-based contributions and collaboration dynamics is crucial to addressing this gap and creating a more inclusive research environment. In this study, we analyzed 2,000 articles published over the past decade in the Journal of Systems and Software (JSS). From these, we selected 384 articles that detailed authors' contributions and contained both female and male authors to investigate gender-based contributions. Our contributions are fourfold. First, we analyzed women's engagement in software systems research. Our analysis showed that only 32.74% of the total authors are women and female-led or supervised studies were fewer than those of men. Second, we investigated female authors' contributions across 14 major roles. Interestingly, we found that women contributed comparably to men in most roles, with more contributions in conceptualization, writing, and reviewing articles. Third, we explored the areas of software systems research and found that female authors are more actively involved in human-centric research domains. Finally, we analyzed gender-based collaboration dynamics. Our findings revealed that female supervisors tended to collaborate locally more often than national-level collaborations. Our study highlights that females' contributions to software systems research are comparable to those of men. Therefore, the barriers need to be addressed to enhance female participation and ensure equity and inclusivity in research.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15661.pdf,"Shamse Tasnim Cynthia, Saikat Mondal, Joy Krishan Das, Banani Roy",cs.SE

Fourier Position Embedding: Enhancing Attention's Periodic Extension for Length Generalization,"Extending the context length of Language Models (LMs) by improving Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has become a trend. While existing works mainly address RoPE's limitations within attention mechanism, this paper provides an analysis across nearly all parts of LMs, uncovering their adverse effects on length generalization for RoPE-based attention. Using Discrete Signal Processing theory, we show that RoPE enables periodic attention by implicitly achieving Non-Uniform Discrete Fourier Transform. However, this periodicity is undermined by the spectral damage caused by: 1) linear layers and activation functions outside of attention; 2) insufficiently trained frequency components brought by time-domain truncation. Building on our observations, we propose Fourier Position Embedding (FoPE), which enhances attention's frequency-domain properties to improve both its periodic extension and length generalization. FoPE constructs Fourier Series and zero-outs the destructive frequency components, increasing model robustness against the spectrum damage. Experiments across various model scales and benchmarks show that, within varying context windows, FoPE maintains a more stable performance compared to RoPE and ALiBi. Several analyses and ablations bring further support to our method and theoretical modeling.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17739.pdf,"Ermo Hua, Che Jiang, Xingtai Lv, Kaiyan Zhang, Ning Ding, Youbang Sun, Biqing Qi, Yuchen Fan, Xuekai Zhu, Bowen Zhou",cs.AI
AutoDroid-V2: Boosting SLM-based GUI Agents via Code Generation,"Large language models (LLMs) have brought exciting new advances to mobile UI agents, a long-standing research field that aims to complete arbitrary natural language tasks through mobile UI interactions. However, existing UI agents usually demand powerful large language models that are difficult to be deployed locally on end-users' devices, raising huge concerns about user privacy and centralized serving cost. Inspired by the remarkable coding abilities of recent small language models (SLMs), we propose to convert the UI task automation problem to a code generation problem, which can be effectively solved by an on-device SLM and efficiently executed with an on-device code interpreter. Unlike normal coding tasks that can be extensively pre-trained with public datasets, generating UI automation code is challenging due to the diversity, complexity, and variability of target apps. Therefore, we adopt a document-centered approach that automatically builds fine-grained API documentation for each app and generates diverse task samples based on this documentation. By guiding the agent with the synthetic documents and task samples, it learns to generate precise and efficient scripts to complete unseen tasks. Based on detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art mobile UI agents, our approach effectively improves the mobile task automation with significantly higher success rates and lower latency/token consumption.

LSAQ: Layer-Specific Adaptive Quantization for Large Language Model Deployment,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across various domains, deploying LLMs on edge devices has emerged as a new trend. Quantization techniques, which reduce the size and memory requirements of LLMs, are effective for deploying LLMs on resource-limited edge devices. However, existing one-size-fits-all quantization methods often fail to dynamically adjust the memory requirements of LLMs, limiting their applications to practical edge devices with various computation resources. To tackle this issue, we propose Layer-Specific Adaptive Quantization (LSAQ), a system for adaptive quantization and dynamic deployment of LLMs based on layer importance. Specifically, LSAQ evaluates the importance of LLMs' neural layers by constructing top-k token sets from the inputs and outputs of each layer and calculating their Jaccard similarity. Based on layer importance, our system adaptively adjusts quantization strategies in real time according to the computation resource of edge devices, which applies higher quantization precision to layers with higher importance, and vice versa. {Experimental results show that LSAQ consistently outperforms the selected quantization baselines in terms of perplexity and zero-shot tasks. Additionally, it can devise appropriate quantization schemes for different usage scenarios to facilitate the deployment of LLMs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18135.pdf,"Binrui Zeng, Bin Ji, Xiaodong Liu, Jie Yu, Shasha Li, Jun Ma, Xiaopeng Li, Shangwen Wang, Xinran Hong, Yongtao Tang",cs.CL
Enhancing Multi-Robot Semantic Navigation Through Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Score Collaboration,"Understanding how humans cooperatively utilize semantic knowledge to explore unfamiliar environments and decide on navigation directions is critical for house service multi-robot systems. Previous methods primarily focused on single-robot centralized planning strategies, which severely limited exploration efficiency. Recent research has considered decentralized planning strategies for multiple robots, assigning separate planning models to each robot, but these approaches often overlook communication costs. In this work, we propose Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Co-Navigation (MCoCoNav), a modular approach that utilizes multimodal Chain-of-Thought to plan collaborative semantic navigation for multiple robots. MCoCoNav combines visual perception with Vision Language Models (VLMs) to evaluate exploration value through probabilistic scoring, thus reducing time costs and achieving stable outputs. Additionally, a global semantic map is used as a communication bridge, minimizing communication overhead while integrating observational results. Guided by scores that reflect exploration trends, robots utilize this map to assess whether to explore new frontier points or revisit history nodes.

Linear Model of Aggregated Homogeneous Energy Storage Elements with Realizable Dispatch Guarantees,"To optimize the dispatch of batteries, a model is required that can predict the state of charge (SOC) trajectory for a chosen open-loop power schedule to ensure admissibility (i.e., that schedule can be realized). However, battery dispatch optimization is inherently challenging since batteries cannot simultaneously charge and discharge, which begets a non-convex complementarity constraint. In this paper, we develop a novel composition of energy storage elements that can charge or discharge independently and provide a sufficient linear energy storage model of the composite battery. This permits convex optimization of the composite battery SOC trajectory while guaranteeing admissibility of the resulting (aggregated) power schedule and its disaggregation to the individual energy storage elements.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04508.pdf,"Mazen Elsaadany, Mads R.

Synergizing Large Language Models and Task-specific Models for Time Series Anomaly Detection,"In anomaly detection, methods based on large language models (LLMs) can incorporate expert knowledge by reading professional document, while task-specific small models excel at extracting normal data patterns and detecting value fluctuations from training data of target applications. Inspired by the human nervous system, where the brain stores expert knowledge and the peripheral nervous system and spinal cord handle specific tasks like withdrawal and knee-jerk reflexes, we propose CoLLaTe, a framework designed to facilitate collaboration between LLMs and task-specific models, leveraging the strengths of both models for anomaly detection.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05675.pdf,"Feiyi Chen, Leilei Zhang, Guansong Pang, Roger Zimmermann, Shuiguang Deng",cs.AI
A Quantitative Evaluation of Approximate Softmax Functions for Deep Neural Networks,"The softmax function is a widely used activation function in the output layers of neural networks, responsible for converting raw scores into class probabilities while introducing essential non-linearity. Implementing Softmax efficiently poses challenges on low-end FPGAs due to limited hardware resources and the computational complexity of exponential and division operations. This work evaluates approximate computing techniques for softmax acceleration using Taylor series and interpolation methods using Look-Up Tables (LUTs). These approximations aim to reduce execution time and resource consumption while maintaining acceptable levels of numerical precision. Our findings show that quadratic interpolation with LUTs yields the lowest numerical error. In contrast, Taylor-based approximations offer significantly better performance in terms of execution time and resource efficiency due to their computational simplicity. When applied to real-world deep learning models such as LeNet-5 and MobileNet v2, the first- and second-order Taylor approximations provided substantial trade-offs between accuracy and resource savings, achieving up to 0.2% accuracy degradation and 14% resource reduction compared to exact implementations. These results highlight the effectiveness of approximate Softmax designs on resource-constrained FPGAs and lay the groundwork for their integration into larger models, including large language models (LLMs).",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13379.pdf,"Anthony Leiva-Valverde, Fabricio Elizondo-Fern\'andez, Luis G.

A Cognitive Paradigm Approach to Probe the Perception-Reasoning Interface in VLMs,"A fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence involves understanding the cognitive mechanisms underlying visual reasoning in sophisticated models like Vision-Language Models (VLMs). How do these models integrate visual perception with abstract thought, especially when reasoning across multiple images or requiring fine-grained compositional understanding? Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, this paper introduces a structured evaluation framework using diverse visual reasoning tasks-Bongard Problems (BPs) and Winoground-to dissect the perception-reasoning interface in VLMs. We propose three distinct evaluation paradigms, mirroring human problem-solving strategies: Direct Visual Rule Learning (DVRL; holistic processing), Deductive Rule Learning (DRL; rule extraction and application), and Componential Analysis (CA; analytical decomposition via task-agnostic textual descriptions). These paradigms systematically vary cognitive load and probe processing stages. Notably, CA enables multi-image reasoning evaluation even for single-image architectures and isolates reasoning from perception by operating on textual descriptions. Applying this framework, we demonstrate that CA, leveraging powerful language models for reasoning over rich, independently generated descriptions, achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on challenging benchmarks including Bongard-OpenWorld, Bongard-HOI, and Winoground. Ablation studies confirm reasoning improves significantly when perceptual challenges are mitigated, revealing a critical perception bottleneck. Our framework provides a valuable diagnostic tool and suggests that decoupling perception (via rich, task-agnostic description) from reasoning is a promising direction for robust and general visual intelligence.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13620.pdf,"Mohit Vaishnav, Tanel Tammet",cs.CV
Self-reflecting Large Language Models: A Hegelian Dialectical Approach,"Investigating NLP through a philosophical lens has recently caught researcher's eyes as it connects computational methods with classical schools of philosophy. This paper introduces a philosophical approach inspired by the \textit{Hegelian Dialectic} for LLMs' \textit{self-reflection}, utilizing a self-dialectical approach to emulate internal critiques and then synthesize new ideas by resolving the opposing points of view. Moreover, this paper investigates the effect of LLMs' temperature for generation by establishing a dynamic annealing approach, which promotes the creativity in the early stages and gradually refines it by focusing on the nuances, as well as a fixed-temperature strategy for generation. We assess the effectiveness of our proposed method in generating novel ideas and in improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs during problem-solving. Moreover, we implement a Multi-Agent Majority Voting (MAMV) strategy to assess the validity and novelty of the generated ideas, which proves useful in the absence of domain experts. Our experiments demonstrate promising results in generating ideas and enhancing problem-solving performance.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.14917.pdf,"Sara Abdali, Can Goksen, Saeed Amizadeh, Julie E.

Recognize Any Surgical Object: Unleashing the Power of Weakly-Supervised Data,"We present RASO, a foundation model designed to Recognize Any Surgical Object, offering robust open-set recognition capabilities across a broad range of surgical procedures and object classes, in both surgical images and videos. RASO leverages a novel weakly-supervised learning framework that generates tag-image-text pairs automatically from large-scale unannotated surgical lecture videos, significantly reducing the need for manual annotations. Our scalable data generation pipeline gathers 2,200 surgical procedures and produces 3.6 million tag annotations across 2,066 unique surgical tags. Our experiments show that RASO achieves improvements of 2.9 mAP, 4.5 mAP, 10.6 mAP, and 7.2 mAP on four standard surgical benchmarks, respectively, in zero-shot settings, and surpasses state-of-the-art models in supervised surgical action recognition tasks.

HardML: A Benchmark For Evaluating Data Science And Machine Learning knowledge and reasoning in AI,"We present HardML, a benchmark designed to evaluate the knowledge and reasoning abilities in the fields of data science and machine learning. HardML comprises a diverse set of 100 challenging multiple-choice questions, handcrafted over a period of 6 months, covering the most popular and modern branches of data science and machine learning. These questions are challenging even for a typical Senior Machine Learning Engineer to answer correctly. To minimize the risk of data contamination, HardML uses mostly original content devised by the author. Current state of the art AI models achieve a 30% error rate on this benchmark, which is about 3 times larger than the one achieved on the equivalent, well known MMLU ML. While HardML is limited in scope and not aiming to push the frontier, primarily due to its multiple choice nature, it serves as a rigorous and modern testbed to quantify and track the progress of top AI. While plenty benchmarks and experimentation in LLM evaluation exist in other STEM fields like mathematics, physics and chemistry, the subfields of data science and machine learning remain fairly underexplored.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15627.pdf,Tidor-Vlad Pricope,cs.LG
Applications of Artificial Intelligence for Cross-language Intelligibility Assessment of Dysarthric Speech,"Purpose: Speech intelligibility is a critical outcome in the assessment and management of dysarthria, yet most research and clinical practices have focused on English, limiting their applicability across languages. This commentary introduces a conceptual framework--and a demonstration of how it can be implemented--leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to advance cross-language intelligibility assessment of dysarthric speech. Method: We propose a two-tiered conceptual framework consisting of a universal speech model that encodes dysarthric speech into acoustic-phonetic representations, followed by a language-specific intelligibility assessment model that interprets these representations within the phonological or prosodic structures of the target language. We further identify barriers to cross-language intelligibility assessment of dysarthric speech, including data scarcity, annotation complexity, and limited linguistic insights into dysarthric speech, and outline potential AI-driven solutions to overcome these challenges. Conclusion: Advancing cross-language intelligibility assessment of dysarthric speech necessitates models that are both efficient and scalable, yet constrained by linguistic rules to ensure accurate and language-sensitive assessment. Recent advances in AI provide the foundational tools to support this integration, shaping future directions toward generalizable and linguistically informed assessment frameworks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15858.pdf,"Eunjung Yeo, Julie Liss, Visar Berisha, David Mortensen",cs.CL
EPOCH: Enabling Preemption Operation for Context Saving in Heterogeneous FPGA Systems,"FPGAs are increasingly used in multi-tenant cloud environments to offload compute-intensive tasks from the main CPU. The operating system (OS) plays a vital role in identifying tasks suitable for offloading and coordinating between the CPU and FPGA for seamless task execution. The OS leverages preemption to manage CPU efficiently and balance CPU time; however, preempting tasks running on FPGAs without context loss remains challenging. Despite growing reliance on FPGAs, vendors have yet to deliver a solution that fully preserves and restores task context. This paper presents EPOCH, the first out-of-the-box framework to seamlessly preserve the state of tasks running on multi-tenant cloud FPGAs. EPOCH enables interrupting a tenant's execution at any arbitrary clock cycle, capturing its state, and saving this 'state snapshot' in off-chip memory with fine-grain granularity. Subsequently, when task resumption is required, EPOCH can resume execution from the saved 'state snapshot', eliminating the need to restart the task from scratch. EPOCH automates intricate processes, shields users from complexities, and synchronizes all underlying logic in a common clock domain, mitigating timing violations and ensuring seamless handling of interruptions. EPOCH proficiently captures the state of fundamental FPGA elements, such as look-up tables, flip-flops, block--RAMs, and digital signal processing units. On real hardware, ZynQ-XC7Z020 SoC, the proposed solution achieves context save and restore operations per frame in 62.2us and 67.4us, respectively.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16205.pdf,"Arsalan Ali Malik, Emre Karabulut, Aydin Aysu",cs.DC
Deformable Beta Splatting,"3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has advanced radiance field reconstruction by enabling real-time rendering. However, its reliance on Gaussian kernels for geometry and low-order Spherical Harmonics (SH) for color encoding limits its ability to capture complex geometries and diverse colors. We introduce Deformable Beta Splatting (DBS), a deformable and compact approach that enhances both geometry and color representation. DBS replaces Gaussian kernels with deformable Beta Kernels, which offer bounded support and adaptive frequency control to capture fine geometric details with higher fidelity while achieving better memory efficiency. In addition, we extended the Beta Kernel to color encoding, which facilitates improved representation of diffuse and specular components, yielding superior results compared to SH-based methods. Furthermore, Unlike prior densification techniques that depend on Gaussian properties, we mathematically prove that adjusting regularized opacity alone ensures distribution-preserved Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), independent of the splatting kernel type. Experimental results demonstrate that DBS achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while utilizing only 45% of the parameters and rendering 1.5x faster than 3DGS-MCMC, highlighting the superior performance of DBS for real-time radiance field rendering. Interactive demonstrations and source code are available on our project website: https://rongliu-leo.github.io/beta-splatting/.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18630.pdf,"Rong Liu, Dylan Sun, Meida Chen, Yue Wang, Andrew Feng",cs.CV
Regularized second-order optimization of tensor-network Born machines,"Tensor-network Born machines (TNBMs) are quantum-inspired generative models for learning data distributions. Using tensor-network contraction and optimization techniques, the model learns an efficient representation of the target distribution, capable of capturing complex correlations with a compact parameterization. Despite their promise, the optimization of TNBMs presents several challenges. A key bottleneck of TNBMs is the logarithmic nature of the loss function commonly used for this problem. The single-tensor logarithmic optimization problem cannot be solved analytically, necessitating an iterative approach that slows down convergence and increases the risk of getting trapped in one of many non-optimal local minima. In this paper, we present an improved second-order optimization technique for TNBM training, which significantly enhances convergence rates and the quality of the optimized model. Our method employs a modified Newton's method on the manifold of normalized states, incorporating regularization of the loss landscape to mitigate local minima issues. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by training a one-dimensional matrix product state (MPS) on both discrete and continuous datasets, showcasing its advantages in terms of stability and efficiency, and demonstrating its potential as a robust and scalable approach for optimizing quantum-inspired generative models.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18691.pdf,"Matan Ben-Dov, Jing Chen",cs.LG
HadamRNN: Binary and Sparse Ternary Orthogonal RNNs,"Binary and sparse ternary weights in neural networks enable faster computations and lighter representations, facilitating their use on edge devices with limited computational power. Meanwhile, vanilla RNNs are highly sensitive to changes in their recurrent weights, making the binarization and ternarization of these weights inherently challenging. To date, no method has successfully achieved binarization or ternarization of vanilla RNN weights. We present a new approach leveraging the properties of Hadamard matrices to parameterize a subset of binary and sparse ternary orthogonal matrices. This method enables the training of orthogonal RNNs (ORNNs) with binary and sparse ternary recurrent weights, effectively creating a specific class of binary and sparse ternary vanilla RNNs. The resulting ORNNs, called HadamRNN and Block-HadamRNN, are evaluated on benchmarks such as the copy task, permuted and sequential MNIST tasks, the IMDB dataset, two GLUE benchmarks, and two IoT benchmarks. Despite binarization or sparse ternarization, these RNNs maintain performance levels comparable to state-of-the-art full-precision models, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, our approach is the first solution with binary recurrent weights capable of tackling the copy task over 1000 timesteps.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00047.pdf,"Armand Foucault (IMT, ANITI), Franck Mamalet (ANITI), Fran\c{c}ois Malgouyres (IMT)",cs.LG
Predicting potentially abusive clauses in Chilean terms of services with natural language processing,"This study addresses the growing concern of information asymmetry in consumer contracts, exacerbated by the proliferation of online services with complex Terms of Service that are rarely even read. Even though research on automatic analysis methods is conducted, the problem is aggravated by the general focus on English-language Machine Learning approaches and on major jurisdictions, such as the European Union. We introduce a new methodology and a substantial dataset addressing this gap. We propose a novel annotation scheme with four categories and a total of 20 classes, and apply it on 50 online Terms of Service used in Chile. Our evaluation of transformer-based models highlights how factors like language- and/or domain-specific pre-training, few-shot sample size, and model architecture affect the detection and classification of potentially abusive clauses. Results show a large variability in performance for the different tasks and models, with the highest macro-F1 scores for the detection task ranging from 79% to 89% and micro-F1 scores up to 96%, while macro-F1 scores for the classification task range from 60% to 70% and micro-F1 scores from 64% to 80%. Notably, this is the first Spanish-language multi-label classification dataset for legal clauses, applying Chilean law and offering a comprehensive evaluation of Spanish-language models in the legal domain. Our work lays the ground for future research in method development for rarely considered legal analysis and potentially leads to practical applications to support consumers in Chile and Latin America as a whole.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00865.pdf,"Christoffer Loeffler, Andrea Mart\'inez Freile, Tom\'as Rey Pizarro",cs.CL
Flow-based Domain Randomization for Learning and Sequencing Robotic Skills,"Domain randomization in reinforcement learning is an established technique for increasing the robustness of control policies trained in simulation. By randomizing environment properties during training, the learned policy can become robust to uncertainties along the randomized dimensions. While the environment distribution is typically specified by hand, in this paper we investigate automatically discovering a sampling distribution via entropy-regularized reward maximization of a normalizing-flow-based neural sampling distribution. We show that this architecture is more flexible and provides greater robustness than existing approaches that learn simpler, parameterized sampling distributions, as demonstrated in six simulated and one real-world robotics domain. Lastly, we explore how these learned sampling distributions, combined with a privileged value function, can be used for out-of-distribution detection in an uncertainty-aware multi-step manipulation planner.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01800.pdf,"Aidan Curtis, Eric Li, Michael Noseworthy, Nishad Gothoskar, Sachin Chitta, Hui Li, Leslie Pack Kaelbling, Nicole Carey",cs.RO
Firewalls to Secure Dynamic LLM Agentic Networks,"Future LLM agents are likely to communicate on behalf of users with other entity-representing agents on tasks that entail long-horizon plans with interdependent goals. Current work does not focus on such agentic networks, nor does it address their challenges. Thus, we first identify the required properties of agents' communication, which should be proactive and adaptable. It needs to satisfy 1) privacy: agents should not share more than what is needed for the task, and 2) security: the communication must preserve integrity and maintain utility against selfish entities. We design a use case (travel planning) as a testbed that exemplifies these requirements, and we show examples of how this can go wrong. Next, we propose a practical design, inspired by established network security principles, for constrained LLM agentic networks that balance adaptability, security, and privacy. Our framework automatically constructs and updates task-specific rules from prior simulations to build firewalls. We offer layers of defense to 1) convert free-form input to a task-specific protocol, 2) dynamically abstract users' data to a task-specific degree of permissiveness, and 3) self-correct the agents' trajectory.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01822.pdf,"Sahar Abdelnabi, Amr Gomaa, Per Ola Kristensson, Reza Shokri",cs.CR
Stop treating `AGI' as the north-star goal of AI research,"The AI research community plays a vital role in shaping the scientific, engineering, and societal goals of AI research. In this position paper, we argue that focusing on the highly contested topic of `artificial general intelligence' (`AGI') undermines our ability to choose effective goals. We identify six key traps -- obstacles to productive goal setting -- that are aggravated by AGI discourse: Illusion of Consensus, Supercharging Bad Science, Presuming Value-Neutrality, Goal Lottery, Generality Debt, and Normalized Exclusion. To avoid these traps, we argue that the AI research community needs to (1) prioritize specificity in engineering and societal goals, (2) center pluralism about multiple worthwhile approaches to multiple valuable goals, and (3) foster innovation through greater inclusion of disciplines and communities.

Learning Memory and Material Dependent Constitutive Laws,"We propose and study a neural operator framework for learning memory- and material microstructure-dependent constitutive laws for heterogeneous materials. We work in the two-scale setting where homogenization theory provides a systematic approach to deriving macroscale constitutive laws, obviating the need to resolve complex microstructure repeatedly. However, the unit cell problems defining these constitutive models are typically not amenable to explicit evaluation. It is therefore of interest to learn constitutive models from data generated by the unit cell problem. Our proposed framework models homogenized constitutive laws with both memory- and microstructure-dependence through the use of Markovian recurrent and Fourier neural operators. The homogenization problem for Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic materials is studied to provide firm theoretical foundations for our model. The theoretical properties of the cell problem in this Kelvin-Voigt setting motivate the proposed learning framework; and are also used to prove a universal approximation theorem for the learned macroscale constitutive model. Numerical experiments show that the proposed learning framework accurately learns memory- and microstructure-dependent viscoelastic and elasto-viscoplastic constitutive models, beyond the setting of the theory. Furthermore, we show that the learned constitutive models can be successfully deployed in macroscale simulation of material deformation for different microstructures without retraining.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05463.pdf,"Kaushik Bhattacharya, Lianghao Cao, George Stepaniants, Andrew Stuart, Margaret Trautner",math.NA
Reward-Based Collision-Free Algorithm for Trajectory Planning of Autonomous Robots,"This paper proposes a novel mission planning algorithm for autonomous robots that selects an optimal waypoint sequence from a predefined set to maximize total reward while satisfying obstacle avoidance, state, input, derivative, mission time, and distance constraints. The formulation extends the prize-collecting traveling salesman problem. A tailored genetic algorithm evolves candidate solutions using a fitness function, crossover, and mutation, with constraint enforcement via a penalty method. Differential flatness and clothoid curves are employed to penalize infeasible trajectories efficiently, while the Euler spiral method ensures curvature-continuous trajectories with bounded curvature, enhancing dynamic feasibility and mitigating oscillations typical of minimum-jerk and snap parameterizations. Due to the discrete variable length optimization space, crossover is performed using a dynamic time-warping-based method and extended convex combination with projection. The algorithm's performance is validated through simulations and experiments with a ground vehicle, quadrotor, and quadruped, supported by benchmarking and time-complexity analysis.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.06149.pdf,"Jose D.

Music for All: Representational Bias and Cross-Cultural Adaptability of Music Generation Models,"The advent of Music-Language Models has greatly enhanced the automatic music generation capability of AI systems, but they are also limited in their coverage of the musical genres and cultures of the world. We present a study of the datasets and research papers for music generation and quantify the bias and under-representation of genres. We find that only 5.7% of the total hours of existing music datasets come from non-Western genres, which naturally leads to disparate performance of the models across genres. We then investigate the efficacy of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques in mitigating this bias. Our experiments with two popular models -- MusicGen and Mustango, for two underrepresented non-Western music traditions -- Hindustani Classical and Turkish Makam music, highlight the promises as well as the non-triviality of cross-genre adaptation of music through small datasets, implying the need for more equitable baseline music-language models that are designed for cross-cultural transfer learning.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07328.pdf,"Atharva Mehta, Shivam Chauhan, Amirbek Djanibekov, Atharva Kulkarni, Gus Xia, Monojit Choudhury",cs.SD
Novel computational workflows for natural and biomedical image processing based on hypercomplex algebras,"Hypercomplex image processing extends conventional techniques in a unified paradigm encompassing algebraic and geometric principles. This work leverages quaternions and the two-dimensional orthogonal planes split framework (splitting of a quaternion - representing a pixel - into pairs of orthogonal 2D planes) for natural/biomedical image analysis through the following computational workflows and outcomes: natural/biomedical image re-colorization, natural image de-colorization, natural/biomedical image contrast enhancement, computational re-staining and stain separation in histological images, and performance gains in machine/deep learning pipelines for histological images. The workflows are analyzed separately for natural and biomedical images to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The proposed workflows can regulate color appearance (e.g. with alternative renditions and grayscale conversion) and image contrast, be part of automated image processing pipelines (e.g. isolating stain components, boosting learning models), and assist in digital pathology applications (e.g. enhancing biomarker visibility, enabling colorblind-friendly renditions). Employing only basic arithmetic and matrix operations, this work offers a computationally accessible methodology - in the hypercomplex domain - that showcases versatility and consistency across image processing tasks and a range of computer vision and biomedical applications. The proposed non-data-driven methods achieve comparable or better results (particularly in cases involving well-known methods) to those reported in the literature, showcasing the potential of robust theoretical frameworks with practical effectiveness.

Caught in the Web of Words: Do LLMs Fall for Spin in Medical Literature?,"Medical research faces well-documented challenges in translating novel treatments into clinical practice. Publishing incentives encourage researchers to present ""positive"" findings, even when empirical results are equivocal. Consequently, it is well-documented that authors often spin study results, especially in article abstracts. Such spin can influence clinician interpretation of evidence and may affect patient care decisions. In this study, we ask whether the interpretation of trial results offered by Large Language Models (LLMs) is similarly affected by spin. This is important since LLMs are increasingly being used to trawl through and synthesize published medical evidence. We evaluated 22 LLMs and found that they are across the board more susceptible to spin than humans. They might also propagate spin into their outputs: We find evidence, e.g., that LLMs implicitly incorporate spin into plain language summaries that they generate. We also find, however, that LLMs are generally capable of recognizing spin, and can be prompted in a way to mitigate spin's impact on LLM outputs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07963.pdf,"Hye Sun Yun, Karen Y.

Instance Segmentation of Scene Sketches Using Natural Image Priors,"Sketch segmentation involves grouping pixels within a sketch that belong to the same object or instance. It serves as a valuable tool for sketch editing tasks, such as moving, scaling, or removing specific components. While image segmentation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in recent years, sketches present unique challenges for these models due to their sparse nature and wide variation in styles. We introduce InkLayer, a method for instance segmentation of raster scene sketches. Our approach adapts state-of-the-art image segmentation and object detection models to the sketch domain by employing class-agnostic fine-tuning and refining segmentation masks using depth cues. Furthermore, our method organizes sketches into sorted layers, where occluded instances are inpainted, enabling advanced sketch editing applications. As existing datasets in this domain lack variation in sketch styles, we construct a synthetic scene sketch segmentation dataset, InkScenes, featuring sketches with diverse brush strokes and varying levels of detail. We use this dataset to demonstrate the robustness of our approach.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09608.pdf,"Mia Tang, Yael Vinker, Chuan Yan, Lvmin Zhang, Maneesh Agrawala",cs.CV
Cooperative Multi-Agent Planning with Adaptive Skill Synthesis,"Despite much progress in training distributed artificial intelligence (AI), building cooperative multi-agent systems with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces challenges in sample efficiency, interpretability, and transferability. Unlike traditional learning-based methods that require extensive interaction with the environment, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in zero-shot planning and complex reasoning. However, existing LLM-based approaches heavily rely on text-based observations and struggle with the non-Markovian nature of multi-agent interactions under partial observability. We present COMPASS, a novel multi-agent architecture that integrates vision-language models (VLMs) with a dynamic skill library and structured communication for decentralized closed-loop decision-making. The skill library, bootstrapped from demonstrations, evolves via planner-guided tasks to enable adaptive strategies. COMPASS propagates entity information through multi-hop communication under partial observability. Evaluations on the improved StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMACv2) demonstrate COMPASS's strong performance against state-of-the-art MARL baselines across both symmetric and asymmetric scenarios.

LLM4Tag: Automatic Tagging System for Information Retrieval via Large Language Models,"Tagging systems play an essential role in various information retrieval applications such as search engines and recommender systems. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied in tagging systems due to their extensive world knowledge, semantic understanding, and reasoning capabilities. Despite achieving remarkable performance, existing methods still have limitations, including difficulties in retrieving relevant candidate tags comprehensively, challenges in adapting to emerging domain-specific knowledge, and the lack of reliable tag confidence quantification. To address these three limitations above, we propose an automatic tagging system LLM4Tag. First, a graph-based tag recall module is designed to effectively and comprehensively construct a small-scale highly relevant candidate tag set. Subsequently, a knowledge-enhanced tag generation module is employed to generate accurate tags with long-term and short-term knowledge injection. Finally, a tag confidence calibration module is introduced to generate reliable tag confidence scores. Extensive experiments over three large-scale industrial datasets show that LLM4Tag significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines and LLM4Tag has been deployed online for content tagging to serve hundreds of millions of users.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13481.pdf,"Ruiming Tang, Chenxu Zhu, Bo Chen, Weipeng Zhang, Menghui Zhu, Xinyi Dai, Huifeng Guo",cs.IR
MoM: Linear Sequence Modeling with Mixture-of-Memories,"Linear sequence modeling methods, such as linear attention, state space modeling, and linear RNNs, offer significant efficiency improvements by reducing the complexity of training and inference. However, these methods typically compress the entire input sequence into a single fixed-size memory state, which leads to suboptimal performance on recall-intensive downstream tasks. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience, particularly the brain's ability to maintain robust long-term memory while mitigating ""memory interference"", we introduce a novel architecture called Mixture-of-Memories (MoM). MoM utilizes multiple independent memory states, with a router network directing input tokens to specific memory states. This approach greatly enhances the overall memory capacity while minimizing memory interference. As a result, MoM performs exceptionally well on recall-intensive tasks, surpassing existing linear sequence modeling techniques. Despite incorporating multiple memory states, the computation of each memory state remains linear in complexity, allowing MoM to retain the linear-complexity advantage during training, while constant-complexity during inference. Our experimental results show that MoM significantly outperforms current linear sequence models on downstream language tasks, particularly recall-intensive tasks, and even achieves performance comparable to Transformer models. The code is released at https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/MoM and is also released as a part of https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMs/Linear-MoE.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13685.pdf,"Jusen Du, Weigao Sun, Disen Lan, Jiaxi Hu, Yu Cheng",cs.CL
An Empirical Risk Minimization Approach for Offline Inverse RL and Dynamic Discrete Choice Model,"We study the problem of estimating Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) models, also known as offline Maximum Entropy-Regularized Inverse Reinforcement Learning (offline MaxEnt-IRL) in machine learning. The objective is to recover reward or $Q^*$ functions that govern agent behavior from offline behavior data. In this paper, we propose a globally convergent gradient-based method for solving these problems without the restrictive assumption of linearly parameterized rewards. The novelty of our approach lies in introducing the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) based IRL/DDC framework, which circumvents the need for explicit state transition probability estimation in the Bellman equation. Furthermore, our method is compatible with non-parametric estimation techniques such as neural networks. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential to be scaled to high-dimensional, infinite state spaces. A key theoretical insight underlying our approach is that the Bellman residual satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition -- a property that, while weaker than strong convexity, is sufficient to ensure fast global convergence guarantees. Through a series of synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms benchmark methods and state-of-the-art alternatives.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14131.pdf,"Enoch H.

English Please: Evaluating Machine Translation with Large Language Models for Multilingual Bug Reports,"Accurate translation of bug reports is critical for efficient collaboration in global software development. In this study, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of machine translation (MT) performance on bug reports, analyzing the capabilities of DeepL, AWS Translate, and large language models such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, and Mistral using data from the Visual Studio Code GitHub repository, specifically focusing on reports labeled with the english-please tag. To assess both translation quality and source language identification accuracy, we employ a range of MT evaluation metrics-including BLEU, BERTScore, COMET, METEOR, and ROUGE-alongside classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Our findings reveal that while ChatGPT (gpt-4o) excels in semantic and lexical translation quality, it does not lead in source language identification. Claude and Mistral achieve the highest F1-scores (0.7182 and 0.7142, respectively), and Gemini records the best precision (0.7414). AWS Translate shows the highest accuracy (0.4717) in identifying source languages.

DEFT: Differentiable Branched Discrete Elastic Rods for Modeling Furcated DLOs in Real-Time,"Autonomous wire harness assembly requires robots to manipulate complex branched cables with high precision and reliability. A key challenge in automating this process is predicting how these flexible and branched structures behave under manipulation. Without accurate predictions, it is difficult for robots to reliably plan or execute assembly operations. While existing research has made progress in modeling single-threaded Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs), extending these approaches to Branched Deformable Linear Objects (BDLOs) presents fundamental challenges. The junction points in BDLOs create complex force interactions and strain propagation patterns that cannot be adequately captured by simply connecting multiple single-DLO models. To address these challenges, this paper presents Differentiable discrete branched Elastic rods for modeling Furcated DLOs in real-Time (DEFT), a novel framework that combines a differentiable physics-based model with a learning framework to: 1) accurately model BDLO dynamics, including dynamic propagation at junction points and grasping in the middle of a BDLO, 2) achieve efficient computation for real-time inference, and 3) enable planning to demonstrate dexterous BDLO manipulation. A comprehensive series of real-world experiments demonstrates DEFT's efficacy in terms of accuracy, computational speed, and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art alternatives.

Optimal Distributed Replacement Paths,"We study the replacement paths problem in the $\mathsf{CONGEST}$ model of distributed computing. Given an $s$-$t$ shortest path $P$, the goal is to compute, for every edge $e$ in $P$, the shortest-path distance from $s$ to $t$ avoiding $e$. For unweighted directed graphs, we establish the tight randomized round complexity bound for this problem as $\widetilde{\Theta}(n^{2/3} + D)$ by showing matching upper and lower bounds. Our upper bound extends to $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation for weighted directed graphs. Our lower bound applies even to the second simple shortest path problem, which asks only for the smallest replacement path length. These results improve upon the very recent work of Manoharan and Ramachandran (SIROCCO 2024), who showed a lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1/2} + D)$ and an upper bound of $\widetilde{O}(n^{2/3} + \sqrt{n h_{st}} + D)$, where $h_{st}$ is the number of hops in the given $s$-$t$ shortest path $P$.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15378.pdf,"Yi-Jun Chang, Yanyu Chen, Dipan Dey, Gopinath Mishra, Hung Thuan Nguyen, Bryce Sanchez",cs.DS
CalibRefine: Deep Learning-Based Online Automatic Targetless LiDAR-Camera Calibration with Iterative and Attention-Driven Post-Refinement,"Accurate multi-sensor calibration is essential for deploying robust perception systems in applications such as autonomous driving and intelligent transportation. Existing LiDAR-camera calibration methods often rely on manually placed targets, preliminary parameter estimates, or intensive data preprocessing, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a fully automatic, targetless, and online calibration framework, CalibRefine, which directly processes raw LiDAR point clouds and camera images. Our approach is divided into four stages: (1) a Common Feature Discriminator that leverages relative spatial positions, visual appearance embeddings, and semantic class cues to identify and generate reliable LiDAR-camera correspondences, (2) a coarse homography-based calibration that uses the matched feature correspondences to estimate an initial transformation between the LiDAR and camera frames, serving as the foundation for further refinement, (3) an iterative refinement to incrementally improve alignment as additional data frames become available, and (4) an attention-based refinement that addresses non-planar distortions by leveraging a Vision Transformer and cross-attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on two urban traffic datasets demonstrate that CalibRefine achieves high-precision calibration with minimal human input, outperforming state-of-the-art targetless methods and matching or surpassing manually tuned baselines. Our results show that robust object-level feature matching, combined with iterative refinement and self-supervised attention-based refinement, enables reliable sensor alignment in complex real-world conditions without ground-truth matrices or elaborate preprocessing.

ToMCAT: Theory-of-Mind for Cooperative Agents in Teams via Multiagent Diffusion Policies,"In this paper we present ToMCAT (Theory-of-Mind for Cooperative Agents in Teams), a new framework for generating ToM-conditioned trajectories. It combines a meta-learning mechanism, that performs ToM reasoning over teammates' underlying goals and future behavior, with a multiagent denoising-diffusion model, that generates plans for an agent and its teammates conditioned on both the agent's goals and its teammates' characteristics, as computed via ToM. We implemented an online planning system that dynamically samples new trajectories (replans) from the diffusion model whenever it detects a divergence between a previously generated plan and the current state of the world. We conducted several experiments using ToMCAT in a simulated cooking domain. Our results highlight the importance of the dynamic replanning mechanism in reducing the usage of resources without sacrificing team performance. We also show that recent observations about the world and teammates' behavior collected by an agent over the course of an episode combined with ToM inferences are crucial to generate team-aware plans for dynamic adaptation to teammates, especially when no prior information is provided about them.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18438.pdf,"Pedro Sequeira, Vidyasagar Sadhu, Melinda Gervasio",cs.MA
BIG-Bench Extra Hard,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in everyday applications, demanding robust general reasoning capabilities and diverse reasoning skillset. However, current LLM reasoning benchmarks predominantly focus on mathematical and coding abilities, leaving a gap in evaluating broader reasoning proficiencies. One particular exception is the BIG-Bench dataset, which has served as a crucial benchmark for evaluating the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs, thanks to its diverse set of challenging tasks that allowed for a comprehensive assessment of general reasoning across various skills within a unified framework. However, recent advances in LLMs have led to saturation on BIG-Bench, and its harder version BIG-Bench Hard (BBH). State-of-the-art models achieve near-perfect scores on many tasks in BBH, thus diminishing its utility. To address this limitation, we introduce BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), a new benchmark designed to push the boundaries of LLM reasoning evaluation. BBEH replaces each task in BBH with a novel task that probes a similar reasoning capability but exhibits significantly increased difficulty. We evaluate various models on BBEH and observe a (harmonic) average accuracy of 9.8\% for the best general-purpose model and 44.8\% for the best reasoning-specialized model, indicating substantial room for improvement and highlighting the ongoing challenge of achieving robust general reasoning in LLMs. We release BBEH publicly at: https://github.com/google-deepmind/bbeh.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19187.pdf,"Mehran Kazemi, Bahare Fatemi, Hritik Bansal, John Palowitch, Chrysovalantis Anastasiou, Sanket Vaibhav Mehta, Lalit K.

BRIDGE: Bootstrapping Text to Control Time-Series Generation via Multi-Agent Iterative Optimization and Diffusion Modelling,"Time-series Generation (TSG) is a prominent research area with broad applications in simulations, data augmentation, and counterfactual analysis. While existing methods have shown promise in unconditional single-domain TSG, real-world applications demand for cross-domain approaches capable of controlled generation tailored to domain-specific constraints and instance-level requirements. In this paper, we argue that text can provide semantic insights, domain information and instance-specific temporal patterns, to guide and improve TSG. We introduce ``Text-Controlled TSG'', a task focused on generating realistic time series by incorporating textual descriptions. To address data scarcity in this setting, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework that synthesizes diverse, realistic text-to-TS datasets. Furthermore, we introduce BRIDGE, a hybrid text-controlled TSG framework that integrates semantic prototypes with text description for supporting domain-level guidance. This approach achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity on 11 of 12 datasets, and improves controllability by 12.52% on MSE and 6.34% MAE compared to no text input generation, highlighting its potential for generating tailored time-series data.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02445.pdf,"Hao Li, Yuhao Huang, Chang Xu, Viktor Schlegel, Renhe Jiang, Riza Batista-Navarro, Goran Nenadic, Jiang Bian",cs.LG
LiteWebAgent: The Open-Source Suite for VLM-Based Web-Agent Applications,"We introduce LiteWebAgent, an open-source suite for VLM-based web agent applications. Our framework addresses a critical gap in the web agent ecosystem with a production-ready solution that combines minimal serverless backend configuration, intuitive user and browser interfaces, and extensible research capabilities in agent planning, memory, and tree search.

In addition, we integrate advanced research components such as agent planning, agent workflow memory, and tree search in a modular and extensible manner. We then integrate the LiteWebAgent agent framework with frontend and backend as deployed systems in two formats: (1) a production Vercel-based web application, which provides users with an agent-controlled remote browser, (2) a Chrome extension leveraging LiteWebAgent's API to control an existing Chrome browser via CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol).

Full-DoF Egomotion Estimation for Event Cameras Using Geometric Solvers,"For event cameras, current sparse geometric solvers for egomotion estimation assume that the rotational displacements are known, such as those provided by an IMU. Thus, they can only recover the translational motion parameters. Recovering full-DoF motion parameters using a sparse geometric solver is a more challenging task, and has not yet been investigated. In this paper, we propose several solvers to estimate both rotational and translational velocities within a unified framework. Our method leverages event manifolds induced by line segments. The problem formulations are based on either an incidence relation for lines or a novel coplanarity relation for normal vectors. We demonstrate the possibility of recovering full-DoF egomotion parameters for both angular and linear velocities without requiring extra sensor measurements or motion priors. To achieve efficient optimization, we exploit the Adam framework with a first-order approximation of rotations for quick initialization. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

CRAFT: Characterizing and Root-Causing Fault Injection Threats at Pre-Silicon,"Fault injection attacks represent a class of threats that can compromise embedded systems across multiple layers of abstraction, such as system software, instruction set architecture (ISA), microarchitecture, and physical implementation. Early detection of these vulnerabilities and understanding their root causes, along with their propagation from the physical layer to the system software, is critical to secure the cyberinfrastructure. This work presents a comprehensive methodology for conducting controlled fault injection attacks at the pre-silicon level and an analysis of the underlying system for root-causing behavior. As the driving application, we use the clock glitch attacks in AI/ML applications for critical misclassification. Our study aims to characterize and diagnose the impact of faults within the RISC-V instruction set and pipeline stages, while tracing fault propagation from the circuit level to the AI/ML application software. This analysis resulted in discovering two new vulnerabilities through controlled clock glitch parameters. First, we reveal a novel method for causing instruction skips, thereby preventing the loading of critical values from memory. This can cause disruption and affect program continuity and correctness. Second, we demonstrate an attack that converts legal instructions into illegal ones, thereby diverting control flow in a manner exploitable by attackers. Our work underscores the complexity of fault injection attack exploits and emphasizes the importance of preemptive security analysis.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03877.pdf,"Arsalan Ali Malik, Harshvadan Mihir, Aydin Aysu",cs.CR

Neural Configuration-Space Barriers for Manipulation Planning and Control,"Planning and control for high-dimensional robot manipulators in cluttered, dynamic environments require both computational efficiency and robust safety guarantees. Inspired by recent advances in learning configuration-space distance functions (CDFs) as robot body representations, we propose a unified framework for motion planning and control that formulates safety constraints as CDF barriers. A CDF barrier approximates the local free configuration space, substantially reducing the number of collision-checking operations during motion planning. However, learning a CDF barrier with a neural network and relying on online sensor observations introduce uncertainties that must be considered during control synthesis. To address this, we develop a distributionally robust CDF barrier formulation for control that explicitly accounts for modeling errors and sensor noise without assuming a known underlying distribution. Simulations and hardware experiments on a 6-DoF xArm manipulator show that our neural CDF barrier formulation enables efficient planning and robust real-time safe control in cluttered and dynamic environments, relying only on onboard point-cloud observations.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04929.pdf,"Kehan Long, Ki Myung Brian Lee, Nikola Raicevic, Niyas Attasseri, Melvin Leok, Nikolay Atanasov",cs.RO
Using Mechanistic Interpretability to Craft Adversarial Attacks against Large Language Models,"Traditional white-box methods for creating adversarial perturbations against LLMs typically rely only on gradient computation from the targeted model, ignoring the internal mechanisms responsible for attack success or failure. Conversely, interpretability studies that analyze these internal mechanisms lack practical applications beyond runtime interventions. We bridge this gap by introducing a novel white-box approach that leverages mechanistic interpretability techniques to craft practical adversarial inputs. Specifically, we first identify acceptance subspaces - sets of feature vectors that do not trigger the model's refusal mechanisms - then use gradient-based optimization to reroute embeddings from refusal subspaces to acceptance subspaces, effectively achieving jailbreaks. This targeted approach significantly reduces computation cost, achieving attack success rates of 80-95\% on state-of-the-art models including Gemma2, Llama3.2, and Qwen2.5 within minutes or even seconds, compared to existing techniques that often fail or require hours of computation. We believe this approach opens a new direction for both attack research and defense development. Furthermore, it showcases a practical application of mechanistic interpretability where other methods are less efficient, which highlights its utility.

CALLM: Understanding Cancer Survivors' Emotions and Intervention Opportunities via Mobile Diaries and Context-Aware Language Models,"Cancer survivors face unique emotional challenges that impact their quality of life. Mobile diary entries provide a promising method for tracking emotional states, improving self-awareness, and promoting well-being outcome. This paper aims to, through mobile diaries, understand cancer survivors' emotional states and key variables related to just-in-time intervention opportunities, including the desire to regulate emotions and the availability to engage in interventions. Although emotion analysis tools show potential for recognizing emotions from text, current methods lack the contextual understanding necessary to interpret brief mobile diary narratives. Our analysis of diary entries from cancer survivors (N=407) reveals systematic relationships between described contexts and emotional states, with administrative and health-related contexts associated with negative affect and regulation needs, while leisure activities promote positive emotions. We propose CALLM, a Context-Aware framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze these brief entries by integrating retrieved peer experiences and personal diary history. CALLM demonstrates strong performance with balanced accuracies reaching 72.96% for positive affect, 73.29% for negative affect, 73.72% for emotion regulation desire, and 60.09% for intervention availability, outperforming language model baselines. Post-hoc analysis reveals that model confidence strongly predicts accuracy, with longer diary entries generally enhancing performance, and brief personalization periods yielding meaningful improvements. Our findings demonstrate how contextual information in mobile diaries can be effectively leveraged to understand emotional experiences, predict key states, and identify optimal intervention moments for personalized just-in-time support.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10707.pdf,"Zhiyuan Wang, Katharine E.

Is Your Imitation Learning Policy Better than Mine? Policy Comparison with Near-Optimal Stopping,"Imitation learning has enabled robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks in challenging dexterous manipulation settings. As new methods are developed, they must be rigorously evaluated and compared against corresponding baselines through repeated evaluation trials. However, policy comparison is fundamentally constrained by a small feasible sample size (e.g., 10 or 50) due to significant human effort and limited inference throughput of policies. This paper proposes a novel statistical framework for rigorously comparing two policies in the small sample size regime. Prior work in statistical policy comparison relies on batch testing, which requires a fixed, pre-determined number of trials and lacks flexibility in adapting the sample size to the observed evaluation data. Furthermore, extending the test with additional trials risks inducing inadvertent p-hacking, undermining statistical assurances. In contrast, our proposed statistical test is sequential, allowing researchers to decide whether or not to run more trials based on intermediate results. This adaptively tailors the number of trials to the difficulty of the underlying comparison, saving significant time and effort without sacrificing probabilistic correctness. Extensive numerical simulation and real-world robot manipulation experiments show that our test achieves near-optimal stopping, letting researchers stop evaluation and make a decision in a near-minimal number of trials. Specifically, it reduces the number of evaluation trials by up to 37% as compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while preserving the probabilistic correctness and statistical power of the comparison. Moreover, our method is strongest in the most challenging comparison instances (requiring the most evaluation trials); in a multi-task comparison scenario, we save the evaluator more than 200 simulation rollouts.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10966.pdf,"David Snyder, Asher James Hancock, Apurva Badithela, Emma Dixon, Patrick Miller, Rares Andrei Ambrus, Anirudha Majumdar, Masha Itkina, Haruki Nishimura",cs.RO
Towards Hierarchical Multi-Step Reward Models for Enhanced Reasoning in Large Language Models,"Recent studies show that Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong reasoning capabilities through supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. However, a key approach, the Process Reward Model (PRM), suffers from reward hacking, making it unreliable in identifying the best intermediate step. In addition, the cost of annotating reasoning processes for reward modeling is high, making large-scale collection of high-quality data challenging. To address this, we propose a novel reward model approach called the Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM), which evaluates both individual and consecutive reasoning steps at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels. HRM excels at assessing multi-step reasoning coherence, especially when flawed steps are later corrected through self-reflection. To further reduce the cost of generating training data, we introduce a lightweight and effective data augmentation strategy called Hierarchical Node Compression (HNC), which merges two consecutive reasoning steps into one within the tree structure. By applying HNC to MCTS-generated reasoning trajectories, we enhance the diversity and robustness of HRM training data while introducing controlled noise with minimal computational overhead. Empirical results on the PRM800K dataset show that HRM, together with HNC, provides more stable and reliable evaluations than PRM. Furthermore, cross-domain evaluations on the MATH500 and GSM8K datasets demonstrate HRM's strong generalization and robustness across a variety of reasoning tasks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13551.pdf,"Teng Wang, Zhangyi Jiang, Zhenqi He, Shenyang Tong, Wenhan Yang, Yanan Zheng, Zeyu Li, Zifan He, Hailei Gong",cs.CL

To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework called Content ARCs (Authenticity, Rights, Compensation). By combining open standards for provenance and dynamic licensing with data attribution, and decentralized technologies, Content ARCs create a mechanism for managing rights and compensating creators for using their work in AI training. We characterize several nascent works in the AI data licensing space within Content ARCs and identify where challenges remain to fully implement the end-to-end framework.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14519.pdf,"Kar Balan, Andrew Gilbert, John Collomosse",cs.CY

Knowledge-guided machine learning for county-level corn yield prediction under drought,"Remote sensing (RS) technique, enabling the non-contact acquisition of extensive ground observations, is a valuable tool for crop yield predictions. Traditional process-based models struggle to incorporate large volumes of RS data, and most users lack understanding of crop growth mechanisms. In contrast, machine learning (ML) models are often criticized as ""black boxes"" due to their limited interpretability. To address these limitations, we utilized Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML), a framework that leverages the strengths of both process-based and ML models. Existing works have either overlooked the role of soil moisture in corn growth or did not embed this effect into their models. To bridge this gap, we developed the Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning with Soil Moisture (KGML-SM) framework, treating soil moisture as an intermediate variable in corn growth to emphasize its key role in plant development. Additionally, based on the prior knowledge that the model may overestimate under drought conditions, we designed a drought-aware loss function that penalized predicted yield in drought-affected areas. Our experiments showed that the KGML-SM model outperformed other traditional ML models. We explored the relationships between drought, soil moisture, and corn yield prediction by assessing the importance of different features within the model, and analyzing how soil moisture impacts predictions across different regions and time periods. Finally we provided interpretability for prediction errors to guide future model optimization.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16328.pdf,"Xiaoyu Wang, Yijia Xu, Jingyi Huang, Zhengwei Yang, Zhou Zhang",cs.LG

CASE -- Condition-Aware Sentence Embeddings for Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity Measurement,"The meaning conveyed by a sentence often depends on the context in which it appears. Despite the progress of sentence embedding methods, it remains unclear how to best modify a sentence embedding conditioned on its context. To address this problem, we propose Condition-Aware Sentence Embeddings (CASE), an efficient and accurate method to create an embedding for a sentence under a given condition. First, CASE creates an embedding for the condition using a Large Language Model (LLM), where the sentence influences the attention scores computed for the tokens in the condition during pooling. Next, a supervised nonlinear projection is learned to reduce the dimensionality of the LLM-based text embeddings. We show that CASE significantly outperforms previously proposed Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity (C-STS) methods on an existing standard benchmark dataset. We find that subtracting the condition embedding consistently improves the C-STS performance of LLM-based text embeddings. Moreover, we propose a supervised dimensionality reduction method that not only reduces the dimensionality of LLM-based embeddings but also significantly improves their performance.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17279.pdf,"Gaifan Zhang, Yi Zhou, Danushka Bollegala",cs.CL
HAIR: Hardness-Aware Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Introspective Reasoning for LLM Alignment,"The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values remains critical yet hindered by four key challenges: (1) scarcity of balanced safety datasets, (2) alignment tax, (3) vulnerability to jailbreak attacks due to shallow alignment, and (4) inability to dynamically adapt rewards according to task difficulty. To address these limitations, we introduce HAIR (Hardness-Aware Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Introspective Reasoning), a novel alignment approach inspired by shadow models in membership inference attacks. Our approach consists of two main components: (1) construction of a balanced safety Chain-of-Draft (CoD) dataset for seven harmful categories using structured prompts that leverage the introspective reasoning capabilities of LLMs; and (2) training of category-specific reward models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), dynamically tuning optimization to task difficulty at both the data and model levels.

Towards Uncertainty Unification: A Case Study for Preference Learning,"Learning human preferences is essential for human-robot interaction, as it enables robots to adapt their behaviors to align with human expectations and goals. However, the inherent uncertainties in both human behavior and robotic systems make preference learning a challenging task. While probabilistic robotics algorithms offer uncertainty quantification, the integration of human preference uncertainty remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce uncertainty unification and propose a novel framework, uncertainty-unified preference learning (UUPL), which enhances Gaussian Process (GP)-based preference learning by unifying human and robot uncertainties. Specifically, UUPL includes a human preference uncertainty model that improves GP posterior mean estimation, and an uncertainty-weighted Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) that enhances GP predictive variance accuracy. Additionally, we design a user-specific calibration process to align uncertainty representations across users, ensuring consistency and reliability in the model performance. Comprehensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that UUPL achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prediction accuracy and user rating. An ablation study further validates the effectiveness of human uncertainty model and uncertainty-weighted GMM of UUPL.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19317.pdf,"Shaoting Peng, Haonan Chen, Katherine Driggs-Campbell",cs.RO

Time hierarchies for sublogarithmic-space quantum computation,"We present new results on the landscape of problems that can be solved by quantum Turing machines (QTM's) employing severely limited amounts of memory. In this context, we demonstrate two infinite time hierarchies of complexity classes within the ``small space'' regime: For all $i\geq 0$, there is a language that can be recognized by a constant-space machine in $2^{O(n^{1/2^i})}$ time, but not by any sublogarithmic-space QTM in $2^{O(n^{1/2^{i+1}})}$ time. For quantum machines operating within $o(\log \log n)$ space, there exists another hierarchy, each level of which corresponds to an expected runtime of $2^{O((\log n)^i)}$ for a different positive integer $i$. We also improve a quantum advantage result, demonstrating a language that can be recognized by a polynomial-time constant-space QTM, but not by any classical machine using $o(\log \log n)$ space, regardless of the time budget. The implications of our findings for quantum space-time tradeoffs are discussed.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21582.pdf,A. C. Cem Say,cs.CC
Coverage-Guaranteed Speech Emotion Recognition via Calibrated Uncertainty-Adaptive Prediction Sets,"Road rage, often triggered by emotional suppression and sudden outbursts, significantly threatens road safety by causing collisions and aggressive behavior.

However, current SER methods, such as those based on hidden markov models and Long short-term memory networks, primarily handle one-dimensional signals, frequently experience overfitting, and lack calibration, limiting their safety-critical effectiveness. We propose a novel risk-controlled prediction framework providing statistically rigorous guarantees on prediction accuracy. This approach employs a calibration set to define a binary loss function indicating whether the true label is included in the prediction set. Using a data-driven threshold $\beta$, we optimize a joint loss function to maintain an expected test loss bounded by a user-specified risk level $\alpha$. Evaluations across six baseline models and two benchmark datasets demonstrate our framework consistently achieves a minimum coverage of $1 - \alpha$, effectively controlling marginal error rates despite varying calibration-test split ratios (e.g., 0.1). The robustness and generalizability of the framework are further validated through an extension to small-batch online calibration under a local exchangeability assumption. We construct a non-negative test martingale to maintain prediction validity even in dynamic and non-exchangeable environments. Cross-dataset tests confirm our method's ability to uphold reliable statistical guarantees in realistic, evolving data scenarios.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22712.pdf,Zijun Jia,cs.SD
Dynamic Parametric Retrieval Augmented Generation for Test-time Knowledge Enhancement,"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from external sources and incorporating them into the context. While it improves reliability by providing factual texts, it significantly increases inference costs as context length grows and introduces challenging issue of RAG hallucination, primarily caused by the lack of corresponding parametric knowledge in LLMs. An efficient solution is to enhance the knowledge of LLMs at test-time. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by embedding document into LLMs parameters to perform test-time knowledge enhancement, effectively reducing inference costs through offline training. However, its high training and storage costs, along with limited generalization ability, significantly restrict its practical adoption. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamic Parametric RAG (DyPRAG), a novel framework that leverages a lightweight parameter translator model to efficiently convert documents into parametric knowledge. DyPRAG not only reduces inference, training, and storage costs but also dynamically generates parametric knowledge, seamlessly enhancing the knowledge of LLMs and resolving knowledge conflicts in a plug-and-play manner at test-time. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capabilities of DyPRAG, offering a powerful and practical RAG paradigm which enables superior knowledge fusion and mitigates RAG hallucination in real-world applications.

LGIN: Defining an Approximately Powerful Hyperbolic GNN,"While graph neural networks (GNNs) operating in hyperbolic spaces have shown promise for modeling hierarchical and complex relational data, a critical limitation often overlooked is their potentially limited discriminative power compared to their Euclidean counterparts or fundamental graph isomorphism tests like the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) hierarchy. Existing hyperbolic aggregation schemes, while curvature-aware, may not sufficiently capture the intricate structural differences required to robustly distinguish non-isomorphic graphs owing to non-injective aggregation functions. To address this expressiveness gap in hyperbolic graph learning, we introduce the Lorentzian Graph Isomorphic Network (LGIN), a novel GNN designed to achieve enhanced discriminative capabilities within the Lorentzian model of hyperbolic space. LGIN proposes a new update rule that effectively combines local neighborhood information with a richer representation of graph structure designed to preserve the Lorentzian metric tensor. This represents a significant step towards building more expressive GNNs in non-Euclidean geometries, overcoming a common bottleneck in current hyperbolic methods. We conduct extensive evaluations across nine diverse benchmark datasets, including molecular and protein structures. LGIN consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art hyperbolic and Euclidean GNNs, showcasing its practical efficacy and validating its superior ability to capture complex graph structures and distinguish between different graphs. To the best of our knowledge, LGIN is the first work to study the framework behind a powerful GNN on the hyperbolic space.

MARIOH: Multiplicity-Aware Hypergraph Reconstruction,"Hypergraphs offer a powerful framework for modeling higher-order interactions that traditional pairwise graphs cannot fully capture. However, practical constraints often lead to their simplification into projected graphs, resulting in substantial information loss and ambiguity in representing higher-order relationships. In this work, we propose MARIOH, a supervised approach for reconstructing the original hypergraph from its projected graph by leveraging edge multiplicity. To overcome the difficulties posed by the large search space, MARIOH integrates several key ideas: (a) identifying provable size-2 hyperedges, which reduces the candidate search space, (b) predicting the likelihood of candidates being hyperedges by utilizing both structural and multiplicity-related features, and (c) not only targeting promising hyperedge candidates but also examining less confident ones to explore alternative possibilities. Together, these ideas enable MARIOH to efficiently and effectively explore the search space. In our experiments using 10 real-world datasets, MARIOH achieves up to 74.51% higher reconstruction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00522.pdf,"Kyuhan Lee, Geon Lee, Kijung Shin",cs.DB
Catch Me if You Search: When Contextual Web Search Results Affect the Detection of Hallucinations,"While we increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for various tasks, these models are known to produce inaccurate content or `hallucinations' with potentially disastrous consequences. The recent integration of web search results into LLMs prompts the question of whether people utilize them to verify the generated content, thereby accurately detecting hallucinations. An online experiment (N = 560) investigated how the provision of search results, either static (i.e., fixed search results provided by LLM) or dynamic (i.e., participant-led searches), affects participants' perceived accuracy of LLM-generated content (i.e., genuine, minor hallucination, major hallucination), self-confidence in accuracy ratings, as well as their overall evaluation of the LLM, as compared to the control condition (i.e., no search results). Results showed that participants in both static and dynamic conditions (vs. control) rated hallucinated content to be less accurate and perceived the LLM more negatively. However, those in the dynamic condition rated genuine content as more accurate and demonstrated greater overall self-confidence in their assessments than those in the static search or control conditions. We highlighted practical implications of incorporating web search functionality into LLMs in real-world contexts.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01153.pdf,"Mahjabin Nahar, Eun-Ju Lee, Jin Won Park, Dongwon Lee",cs.HC
A Machine Learning and Finite Element Framework for Inverse Elliptic PDEs via Dirichlet-to-Neumann Mapping,"Inverse problems for partial differential equations (PDEs) are crucial in numerous applications such as geophysics, biomedical imaging, and material science, where unknown physical properties must be inferred from indirect measurements. In this work, we address the inverse problem for elliptic PDEs by leveraging the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map, which captures the relationship between boundary inputs and flux responses. Thus, this approach enables to solve the inverse problem that seeks the material properties inside the domain by utilizing the boundary data. Our framework employs an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that integrates a finite element method (FEM) in the inner loop for the forward problem, ensuring high accuracy. Moreover our approach is flexible to utilize partial observations of the boundary data, which is often the case in real-world scenarios. By incorporating carefully designed loss functions that accommodate discontinuities, the method refines coefficient reconstructions iteratively. This combined FEM and machine learning approach offers a robust, accurate solution strategy for a broad range of inverse problems, enabling improved estimation of critical parameters in applications from medical diagnostics to subsurface exploration.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03895.pdf,"Dabin Park, Sanghyun Lee, Sunghwan Moon",math.NA
DyTTP: Trajectory Prediction with Normalization-Free Transformers,"Accurate trajectory prediction is a cornerstone for the safe operation of autonomous driving systems, where understanding the dynamic behavior of surrounding agents is crucial. Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios. This work underscores the potential of normalization-free transformer designs augmented with lightweight ensemble techniques in advancing trajectory forecasting for autonomous vehicles.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05356.pdf,"JianLin Zhu, HongKuo Niu",cs.LG
When is the partial map classifier a Sierpi\'nski cone?,"We study the relationship between partial map classifiers, Sierpi\'nski cones, and axioms for synthetic higher categories and domains within univalent foundations. In particular, we show that synthetic $\infty$-categories are closed under partial map classifiers assuming Phoa's principle, and we isolate a new reflective subuniverse of types within which the Sierpi\'nski cone (a lax colimit) can be computed as a partial map classifier by strengthening the Segal condition.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06789.pdf,"Leoni Pugh, Jonathan Sterling",cs.LO
SEAL: Steerable Reasoning Calibration of Large Language Models for Free,"Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's o1-series have demonstrated compelling capabilities for complex reasoning tasks via the extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning mechanism. However, recent studies reveal substantial redundancy in the CoT reasoning traces, which not only increases inference latency but also negatively impacts model performance by diverting attention to unnecessary reasoning paths. To address this issue, we investigate the internal reasoning structures of LLMs and categorize them into three primary thought types: execution, reflection, and transition thoughts. Moreover, our analysis reveals that excessive reflection and transition thoughts are strongly correlated with failure cases and these thought categories exhibit clear separation in the latent space. Based on these, we introduce SEAL (Steerable reasoning calibration), a training-free approach that seamlessly calibrates the CoT process, improving accuracy while demonstrating significant efficiency gains. SEAL consists of an offline stage for extracting the reasoning steering vector in the latent space, followed by an on-the-fly calibration of the reasoning trace through representation intervention using the steering vector. Notably, the steering vector exhibits strong transferability across various tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple models (DeepSeek-R1-Distill and QwQ-32B-Preview) and benchmarks (Math500, GSM8K, LiveCodeBench) validate the effectiveness of SEAL, up to a 11% improvement in accuracy while reducing reasoning tokens by 11.8% to 50.4%.

Towards Combinatorial Interpretability of Neural Computation,"We introduce combinatorial interpretability, a methodology for understanding neural computation by analyzing the combinatorial structures in the sign-based categorization of a network's weights and biases. We demonstrate its power through feature channel coding, a theory that explains how neural networks compute Boolean expressions and potentially underlies other categories of neural network computation. According to this theory, features are computed via feature channels: unique cross-neuron encodings shared among the inputs the feature operates on. Because different feature channels share neurons, the neurons are polysemantic and the channels interfere with one another, making the computation appear inscrutable.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08842.pdf,"Micah Adler, Dan Alistarh, Nir Shavit",cs.LG
Exploring Families' Use and Mediation of Generative AI: A Multi-User Perspective,"Applications of Generative AI (GenAI), such as ChatGPT, have gained popularity among the public due to their ease of access, use, and support of educational and creative activities. Despite these benefits, GenAI poses unique risks for families, such as lacking sufficient safeguards tailored to protect children under 16 years of age and not offering parental control features. This study explores families' use and co-use of GenAI, the perceived risks and opportunities of ChatGPT, and how parents mediate their children's use of GenAI. Through semi-structured interviews with 12 families, we identified ways families used and mediated GenAI and factors that influenced parents' GenAI mediation strategies. We contextualize our findings with a modified model of family mediation strategies, drawing from previous family media and mediation frameworks. We provide insights for future research on family-GenAI interactions and highlight the need for more robust protective measures on GenAI platforms for families.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09004.pdf,"Shirley Zhang, Bengisu Cagiltay, Jennica Li, Dakota Sullivan, Bilge Mutlu, Heather Kirkorian, Kassem Fawaz",cs.HC
CCSK:Cognitive Convection of Self-Knowledge Based Retrieval Augmentation for Large Language Models,"The performance of large language models (LLMs) in Q&A task increased substantially through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) which brings in external knowledge. However, the main difficulty lies in balancing the inherent self-knowledge of LLMs with external information retrieval (IR). The current threshold-based methods apply one-dimensional static mechanisms with single criterion. As a result, their IR decisions might be irrelevant to the LLMs' response under difficult queries. To alleviate this problem, we propose Cognitive Convection of Self-Knowledge (CCSK). Different from traditional methods that maintain single fixed IR activation criteria, CCSK implements a dynamic joint decision process via a Siamese Network module and a Response Quality Model. The Siamese Network calculates the cosine similarity between the current query and the historical queries. The Response Quality Model evaluates the responses of LLMs through LightGBM. The final decision of the CCSK is derived from the outputs of the two modules, as well as text features fused using a multi-head attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that CCSK significantly enhances the model's effectiveness in information retrieval.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10498.pdf,"Jianling Lu, Mingqi Lv, Tieming Chen",cs.IR
The Devil is in the Prompts: Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization for Text-to-Video Generation,"The evolution of Text-to-video (T2V) generative models, trained on large-scale datasets, has been marked by significant progress. However, the sensitivity of T2V generative models to input prompts highlights the critical role of prompt design in influencing generative outcomes. Prior research has predominantly relied on Large Language Models (LLMs) to align user-provided prompts with the distribution of training prompts, albeit without tailored guidance encompassing prompt vocabulary and sentence structure nuances. To this end, we introduce RAPO, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization framework. In order to address potential inaccuracies and ambiguous details generated by LLM-generated prompts. RAPO refines the naive prompts through dual optimization branches, selecting the superior prompt for T2V generation. The first branch augments user prompts with diverse modifiers extracted from a learned relational graph, refining them to align with the format of training prompts via a fine-tuned LLM. Conversely, the second branch rewrites the naive prompt using a pre-trained LLM following a well-defined instruction set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAPO can effectively enhance both the static and dynamic dimensions of generated videos, demonstrating the significance of prompt optimization for user-provided prompts.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.11739.pdf,"Bingjie Gao, Xinyu Gao, Xiaoxue Wu, Yujie Zhou, Yu Qiao, Li Niu, Xinyuan Chen, Yaohui Wang",cs.CV
Cobra: Efficient Line Art COlorization with BRoAder References,"The comic production industry requires reference-based line art colorization with high accuracy, efficiency, contextual consistency, and flexible control. A comic page often involves diverse characters, objects, and backgrounds, which complicates the coloring process. Despite advancements in diffusion models for image generation, their application in line art colorization remains limited, facing challenges related to handling extensive reference images, time-consuming inference, and flexible control. We investigate the necessity of extensive contextual image guidance on the quality of line art colorization. To address these challenges, we introduce Cobra, an efficient and versatile method that supports color hints and utilizes over 200 reference images while maintaining low latency. Central to Cobra is a Causal Sparse DiT architecture, which leverages specially designed positional encodings, causal sparse attention, and Key-Value Cache to effectively manage long-context references and ensure color identity consistency. Results demonstrate that Cobra achieves accurate line art colorization through extensive contextual reference, significantly enhancing inference speed and interactivity, thereby meeting critical industrial demands.

A0: An Affordance-Aware Hierarchical Model for General Robotic Manipulation,"Robotic manipulation faces critical challenges in understanding spatial affordances--the ""where"" and ""how"" of object interactions--essential for complex manipulation tasks like wiping a board or stacking objects. Existing methods, including modular-based and end-to-end approaches, often lack robust spatial reasoning capabilities. Unlike recent point-based and flow-based affordance methods that focus on dense spatial representations or trajectory modeling, we propose A0, a hierarchical affordance-aware diffusion model that decomposes manipulation tasks into high-level spatial affordance understanding and low-level action execution. A0 leverages the Embodiment-Agnostic Affordance Representation, which captures object-centric spatial affordances by predicting contact points and post-contact trajectories. A0 is pre-trained on 1 million contact points data and fine-tuned on annotated trajectories, enabling generalization across platforms. Key components include Position Offset Attention for motion-aware feature extraction and a Spatial Information Aggregation Layer for precise coordinate mapping. The model's output is executed by the action execution module. Experiments on multiple robotic systems (Franka, Kinova, Realman, and Dobot) demonstrate A0's superior performance in complex tasks, showcasing its efficiency, flexibility, and real-world applicability.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12636.pdf,"Rongtao Xu, Jian Zhang, Minghao Guo, Youpeng Wen, Haoting Yang, Min Lin, Jianzheng Huang, Zhe Li, Kaidong Zhang, Liqiong Wang, Yuxuan Kuang, Meng Cao, Feng Zheng, Xiaodan Liang",cs.RO
Just Another Hour on TikTok: Reverse-engineering unique identifiers to obtain a complete slice of TikTok,"TikTok is now a massive platform, and has a deep impact on global events. But for all the preliminary studies done on it, there are still issues with determining fundamental characteristics of the platform. We develop a method to extract a representative sample from a specific time range on TikTok, and use it to collect >99\% of posts from a full hour on the platform, alongside a dataset of >99\% of posts from a single minute from each hour of a day. Through this, we obtain post metadata, video media data, and comments from a close to complete slice of TikTok.

Chain-of-Thought Textual Reasoning for Few-shot Temporal Action Localization,"Traditional temporal action localization (TAL) methods rely on large amounts of detailed annotated data, whereas few-shot TAL reduces this dependence by using only a few training samples to identify unseen action categories. However, existing few-shot TAL methods typically focus solely on video-level information, neglecting textual information, which can provide valuable semantic support for the localization task. Therefore, we propose a new few-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual reasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel few-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to enhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations, which includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align the query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express the temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the textual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought (CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model (VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for videos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available ActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets. We introduce the first dataset named Human-related Anomaly Localization and explore the application of the TAL task in human anomaly detection. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in single-instance and multi-instance scenarios. We will release our code, data and benchmark.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13460.pdf,"Hongwei Ji, Wulian Yun, Mengshi Qi, Huadong Ma",cs.CV
Towards Accurate and Interpretable Neuroblastoma Diagnosis via Contrastive Multi-scale Pathological Image Analysis,"Neuroblastoma, adrenal-derived, is among the most common pediatric solid malignancies, characterized by significant clinical heterogeneity. Timely and accurate pathological diagnosis from hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images is critical for patient prognosis. However, current diagnostic practices primarily rely on subjective manual examination by pathologists, leading to inconsistent accuracy. Existing automated whole-slide image classification methods encounter challenges such as poor interpretability, limited feature extraction capabilities, and high computational costs, restricting their practical clinical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose CMSwinKAN, a contrastive-learning-based multi-scale feature fusion model tailored for pathological image classification, which enhances the Swin Transformer architecture by integrating a Kernel Activation Network within its multilayer perceptron and classification head modules, significantly improving both interpretability and accuracy. By fusing multi-scale features and leveraging contrastive learning strategies, CMSwinKAN mimics clinicians' comprehensive approach, effectively capturing global and local tissue characteristics. Additionally, we introduce a heuristic soft voting mechanism guided by clinical insights to bridge patch-level predictions to whole-slide image-level classifications seamlessly. We verified the CMSwinKAN on the publicly available BreakHis dataset and the PpNTs dataset, which was established by our hospital. Results demonstrate that CMSwinKAN performs better than existing state-of-the-art pathology-specific models pre-trained on large datasets.

We wish to, with constant probability, estimate $\pi(s, t)$ within a constant relative error, unless $\pi(s, t) < \delta$ for some given threshold $\delta$.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16481.pdf,"Christian Bertram, Mads Vestergaard Jensen, Mikkel Thorup, Hanzhi Wang, Shuyi Yan",cs.DS
Hybrid Reinforcement Learning and Model Predictive Control for Adaptive Control of Hydrogen-Diesel Dual-Fuel Combustion,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Machine Learning Integrated Model Predictive Control (ML-MPC) are promising approaches for optimizing hydrogen-diesel dual-fuel engine control, as they can effectively control multiple-input multiple-output systems and nonlinear processes. ML-MPC is advantageous for providing safe and optimal controls, ensuring the engine operates within predefined safety limits. In contrast, RL is distinguished by its adaptability to changing conditions through its learning-based approach. However, the practical implementation of either method alone poses challenges. RL requires high variance in control inputs during early learning phases, which can pose risks to the system by potentially executing unsafe actions, leading to mechanical damage. Conversely, ML-MPC relies on an accurate system model to generate optimal control inputs and has limited adaptability to system drifts, such as injector aging, which naturally occur in engine applications. To address these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid RL and ML-MPC approach that uses an ML-MPC framework while incorporating an RL agent to dynamically adjust the ML-MPC load tracking reference in response to changes in the environment. At the same time, the ML-MPC ensures that actions stay safe throughout the RL agent's exploration. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, fuel pressure is deliberately varied to introduce a model-plant mismatch between the ML-MPC and the engine test bench. The result of this mismatch is a root mean square error (RMSE) in indicated mean effective pressure of 0.57 bar when running the ML-MPC. The experimental results demonstrate that RL successfully adapts to changing boundary conditions by altering the tracking reference while ML-MPC ensures safe control inputs. The quantitative improvement in load tracking by implementing RL is an RSME of 0.44 bar.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16875.pdf,"Julian Bedei, Murray McBain, Alexander Winkler, Charles Robert Koch, Jakob Andert, David Gordon",cs.LG
DreamO: A Unified Framework for Image Customization,"Recently, extensive research on image customization (e.g., identity, subject, style, background, etc.) demonstrates strong customization capabilities in large-scale generative models. However, most approaches are designed for specific tasks, restricting their generalizability to combine different types of condition. Developing a unified framework for image customization remains an open challenge. In this paper, we present DreamO, an image customization framework designed to support a wide range of tasks while facilitating seamless integration of multiple conditions. Specifically, DreamO utilizes a diffusion transformer (DiT) framework to uniformly process input of different types. During training, we construct a large-scale training dataset that includes various customization tasks, and we introduce a feature routing constraint to facilitate the precise querying of relevant information from reference images. Additionally, we design a placeholder strategy that associates specific placeholders with conditions at particular positions, enabling control over the placement of conditions in the generated results. Moreover, we employ a progressive training strategy consisting of three stages: an initial stage focused on simple tasks with limited data to establish baseline consistency, a full-scale training stage to comprehensively enhance the customization capabilities, and a final quality alignment stage to correct quality biases introduced by low-quality data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DreamO can effectively perform various image customization tasks with high quality and flexibly integrate different types of control conditions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16915.pdf,"Chong Mou, Yanze Wu, Wenxu Wu, Zinan Guo, Pengze Zhang, Yufeng Cheng, Yiming Luo, Fei Ding, Shiwen Zhang, Xinghui Li, Mengtian Li, Songtao Zhao, Jian Zhang, Qian He, Xinglong Wu",cs.CV
Can Knowledge Improve Security? A Coding-Enhanced Jamming Approach for Semantic Communication,"As semantic communication (SemCom) attracts growing attention as a novel communication paradigm, ensuring the security of transmitted semantic information over open wireless channels has become a critical issue. However, traditional encryption methods often introduce significant additional communication overhead to maintain stability, and conventional learning-based secure SemCom methods typically rely on a channel capacity advantage for the legitimate receiver, which is challenging to guarantee in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a coding-enhanced jamming method that eliminates the need to transmit a secret key by utilizing shared knowledge-potentially part of the training set of the SemCom system-between the legitimate receiver and the transmitter. Specifically, we leverage the shared private knowledge base to generate a set of private digital codebooks in advance using neural network (NN)-based encoders. For each transmission, we encode the transmitted data into digital sequence Y1 and associate Y1 with a sequence randomly picked from the private codebook, denoted as Y2, through superposition coding. Here, Y1 serves as the outer code and Y2 as the inner code. By optimizing the power allocation between the inner and outer codes, the legitimate receiver can reconstruct the transmitted data using successive decoding with the index of Y2 shared, while the eavesdropper' s decoding performance is severely degraded, potentially to the point of random guessing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable security to state-of-the-art approaches while significantly improving the reconstruction performance of the legitimate receiver by more than 1 dB across varying channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and compression ratios.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16960.pdf,"Weixuan Chen (Sherman), Qianqian Yang (Sherman), Shuo Shao (Sherman), Zhiguo Shi (Sherman), Jiming Chen (Sherman),  Xuemin (Sherman),  Shen",cs.IT
IRA: Adaptive Interest-aware Representation and Alignment for Personalized Multi-interest Retrieval,"Online community platforms require dynamic personalized retrieval and recommendation that can continuously adapt to evolving user interests and new documents. However, optimizing models to handle such changes in real-time remains a major challenge in large-scale industrial settings. To address this, we propose the Interest-aware Representation and Alignment (IRA) framework, an efficient and scalable approach that dynamically adapts to new interactions through a cumulative structure. IRA leverages two key mechanisms: (1) Interest Units that capture diverse user interests as contextual texts, while reinforcing or fading over time through cumulative updates, and (2) a retrieval process that measures the relevance between Interest Units and documents based solely on semantic relationships, eliminating dependence on click signals to mitigate temporal biases. By integrating cumulative Interest Unit updates with the retrieval process, IRA continuously adapts to evolving user preferences, ensuring robust and fine-grained personalization without being constrained by past training distributions. We validate the effectiveness of IRA through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including its deployment in the Home Section of NAVER's CAFE, South Korea's leading community platform.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17529.pdf,"Youngjune Lee, Haeyu Jeong, Changgeon Lim, Jeong Choi, Hongjun Lim, Hangon Kim, Jiyoon Kwon, Saehun Kim",cs.IR
Step1X-Edit: A Practical Framework for General Image Editing,"In recent years, image editing models have witnessed remarkable and rapid development. The recent unveiling of cutting-edge multimodal models such as GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash has introduced highly promising image editing capabilities. These models demonstrate an impressive aptitude for fulfilling a vast majority of user-driven editing requirements, marking a significant advancement in the field of image manipulation. However, there is still a large gap between the open-source algorithm with these closed-source models. Thus, in this paper, we aim to release a state-of-the-art image editing model, called Step1X-Edit, which can provide comparable performance against the closed-source models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 Flash. More specifically, we adopt the Multimodal LLM to process the reference image and the user's editing instruction. A latent embedding has been extracted and integrated with a diffusion image decoder to obtain the target image. To train the model, we build a data generation pipeline to produce a high-quality dataset. For evaluation, we develop the GEdit-Bench, a novel benchmark rooted in real-world user instructions. Experimental results on GEdit-Bench demonstrate that Step1X-Edit outperforms existing open-source baselines by a substantial margin and approaches the performance of leading proprietary models, thereby making significant contributions to the field of image editing.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17761.pdf,"Shiyu Liu, Yucheng Han, Peng Xing, Fukun Yin, Rui Wang, Wei Cheng, Jiaqi Liao, Yingming Wang, Honghao Fu, Chunrui Han, Guopeng Li, Yuang Peng, Quan Sun, Jingwei Wu, Yan Cai, Zheng Ge, Ranchen Ming, Lei Xia, Xianfang Zeng, Yibo Zhu, Binxing Jiao, Xiangyu Zhang, Gang Yu, Daxin Jiang",cs.CV
Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Quality Shifts on Video Streaming Over 5G,"The Quality of Experience (QoE) is the users satisfaction while streaming a video session over an over-the-top (OTT) platform like YouTube. QoE of YouTube reflects the smooth streaming session without any buffering and quality shift events. One of the most important factors nowadays affecting QoE of YouTube is frequent shifts from higher to lower resolutions and vice versa. These shifts ensure a smooth streaming session; however, it might get a lower mean opinion score. For instance, dropping from 1080p to 480p during a video can preserve continuity but might reduce the viewers enjoyment. Over time, OTT platforms are looking for alternative ways to boost user experience instead of relying on traditional Quality of Service (QoS) metrics such as bandwidth, latency, and throughput. As a result, we look into the relationship between quality shifting in YouTube streaming sessions and the channel metrics RSRP, RSRQ, and SNR. Our findings state that these channel metrics positively correlate with shifts. Thus, in real-time, OTT can only rely on them to predict video streaming sessions into lower- and higher-resolution categories, thus providing more resources to improve user experience. Using traditional Machine Learning (ML) classifiers, we achieved an accuracy of 77-percent, while using only RSRP, RSRQ, and SNR. In the era of 5G and beyond, where ultra-reliable, low-latency networks promise enhanced streaming capabilities, the proposed methodology can be used to improve OTT services.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17938.pdf,"Raza Ul Mustafa, Sesha Dassanayake, Noman Ashraf, Romana Aziz, Ala Saleh Alluhaidan",cs.MM
"Optimism, Expectation, or Sarcasm? Multi-Class Hope Speech Detection in Spanish and English","Hope is a complex and underexplored emotional state that plays a significant role in education, mental health, and social interaction. Unlike basic emotions, hope manifests in nuanced forms ranging from grounded optimism to exaggerated wishfulness or sarcasm, making it difficult for Natural Language Processing systems to detect accurately. This study introduces PolyHope V2, a multilingual, fine-grained hope speech dataset comprising over 30,000 annotated tweets in English and Spanish. This resource distinguishes between four hope subtypes Generalized, Realistic, Unrealistic, and Sarcastic and enhances existing datasets by explicitly labeling sarcastic instances. We benchmark multiple pretrained transformer models and compare them with large language models (LLMs) such as GPT 4 and Llama 3 under zero-shot and few-shot regimes. Our findings show that fine-tuned transformers outperform prompt-based LLMs, especially in distinguishing nuanced hope categories and sarcasm. Through qualitative analysis and confusion matrices, we highlight systematic challenges in separating closely related hope subtypes. The dataset and results provide a robust foundation for future emotion recognition tasks that demand greater semantic and contextual sensitivity across languages.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17974.pdf,"Sabur Butt, Fazlourrahman Balouchzahi, Ahmad Imam Amjad, Maaz Amjad, Hector G.

Pushing the boundary on Natural Language Inference,"Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a central task in natural language understanding with applications in fact-checking, question answering, and information retrieval. Despite its importance, current NLI systems heavily rely on supervised learning with datasets that often contain annotation artifacts and biases, limiting generalization and real-world applicability. In this work, we apply a reinforcement learning-based approach using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for Chain-of-Thought (CoT) learning in NLI, eliminating the need for labeled rationales and enabling this type of training on more challenging datasets such as ANLI. We fine-tune 7B, 14B, and 32B language models using parameter-efficient techniques (LoRA and QLoRA), demonstrating strong performance across standard and adversarial NLI benchmarks. Our 32B AWQ-quantized model surpasses state-of-the-art results on 7 out of 11 adversarial sets$\unicode{x2013}$or on all of them considering our replication$\unicode{x2013}$within a 22GB memory footprint, showing that robust reasoning can be retained under aggressive quantization. This work provides a scalable and practical framework for building robust NLI systems without sacrificing inference quality.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18376.pdf,"Pablo Miralles-Gonz\'alez, Javier Huertas-Tato, Alejandro Mart\'in, David Camacho",cs.CL
RepliBench: Evaluating the Autonomous Replication Capabilities of Language Model Agents,"Uncontrollable autonomous replication of language model agents poses a critical safety risk. To better understand this risk, we introduce RepliBench, a suite of evaluations designed to measure autonomous replication capabilities. RepliBench is derived from a decomposition of these capabilities covering four core domains: obtaining resources, exfiltrating model weights, replicating onto compute, and persisting on this compute for long periods. We create 20 novel task families consisting of 86 individual tasks. We benchmark 5 frontier models, and find they do not currently pose a credible threat of self-replication, but succeed on many components and are improving rapidly. Models can deploy instances from cloud compute providers, write self-propagating programs, and exfiltrate model weights under simple security setups, but struggle to pass KYC checks or set up robust and persistent agent deployments. Overall the best model we evaluated (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) has a >50% pass@10 score on 15/20 task families, and a >50% pass@10 score for 9/20 families on the hardest variants. These findings suggest autonomous replication capability could soon emerge with improvements in these remaining areas or with human assistance.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18565.pdf,"Sid Black, Asa Cooper Stickland, Jake Pencharz, Oliver Sourbut, Michael Schmatz, Jay Bailey, Ollie Matthews, Ben Millwood, Alex Remedios, Alan Cooney",cs.CR
Enhancing Privacy in Semantic Communication over Wiretap Channels leveraging Differential Privacy,"Semantic communication (SemCom) improves transmission efficiency by focusing on task-relevant information. However, transmitting semantic-rich data over insecure channels introduces privacy risks. This paper proposes a novel SemCom framework that integrates differential privacy (DP) mechanisms to protect sensitive semantic features. This method employs the generative adversarial network (GAN) inversion technique to extract disentangled semantic features and uses neural networks (NNs) to approximate the DP application and removal processes, effectively mitigating the non-invertibility issue of DP. Additionally, an NN-based encryption scheme is introduced to strengthen the security of channel inputs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively prevents eavesdroppers from reconstructing sensitive information by generating chaotic or fake images, while ensuring high-quality image reconstruction for legitimate users. The system exhibits robust performance across various privacy budgets and channel conditions, achieving an optimal balance between privacy protection and reconstruction fidelity.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18581.pdf,"Weixuan Chen, Shunpu Tang, Qianqian Yang, Zhiguo Shi, Dusit Niyato",cs.CR
A Cognitive-Mechanistic Human Reliability Analysis Framework: A Nuclear Power Plant Case Study,"Traditional human reliability analysis (HRA) methods, such as IDHEAS-ECA, rely on expert judgment and empirical rules that often overlook the cognitive underpinnings of human error. Moreover, conducting human-in-the-loop experiments for advanced nuclear power plants is increasingly impractical due to novel interfaces and limited operational data. This study proposes a cognitive-mechanistic framework (COGMIF) that enhances the IDHEAS-ECA methodology by integrating an ACT-R-based human digital twin (HDT) with TimeGAN-augmented simulation. The ACT-R model simulates operator cognition, including memory retrieval, goal-directed procedural reasoning, and perceptual-motor execution, under high-fidelity scenarios derived from a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) simulator. To overcome the resource constraints of large-scale cognitive modeling, TimeGAN is trained on ACT-R-generated time-series data to produce high-fidelity synthetic operator behavior datasets. These simulations are then used to drive IDHEAS-ECA assessments, enabling scalable, mechanism-informed estimation of human error probabilities (HEPs). Comparative analyses with SPAR-H and sensitivity assessments demonstrate the robustness and practical advantages of the proposed COGMIF. Finally, procedural features are mapped onto a Bayesian network to quantify the influence of contributing factors, revealing key drivers of operational risk. This work offers a credible and computationally efficient pathway to integrate cognitive theory into industrial HRA practices.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18604.pdf,"Xingyu Xiao, Peng Chen, Jiejuan Tong, Shunshun Liu, Hongru Zhao, Jun Zhao, Qianqian Jia, Jingang Liang, Haitao Wang",cs.AI
LiLIS: Enhancing Big Spatial Data Processing with Lightweight Distributed Learned Index,"The efficient management of big spatial data is crucial for location-based services, particularly in smart cities. However, existing systems such as Simba and Sedona, which incorporate distributed spatial indexing, still incur substantial index construction overheads, rendering them far from optimal for real-time analytics. Recent studies demonstrate that learned indices can achieve high efficiency through well-designed machine learning models, but how to design a learned index for distributed spatial analytics remains unaddressed. In this paper, we present LiLIS, a Lightweight Distributed Learned Index for big spatial data. LiLIS combines machine-learned search strategies with spatial-aware partitioning within a distributed framework, and efficiently implements common spatial queries, including point query, range query, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and spatial joins. Extensive experimental results over real-world and synthetic datasets show that LiLIS outperforms state-of-the-art big spatial data analytics by $2-3$ orders of magnitude for most spatial queries, and the index building achieves $1.5-2\times$ speed-up.

UnifyFL: Enabling Decentralized Cross-Silo Federated Learning,"Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning (ML) paradigm in which models are trained on private data across several devices called clients and combined at a single node called an aggregator rather than aggregating the data itself. Many organizations employ FL to have better privacy-aware ML-driven decision-making capabilities. However, organizations often operate independently rather than collaborate to enhance their FL capabilities due to the lack of an effective mechanism for collaboration. The challenge lies in balancing trust and resource efficiency. One approach relies on trusting a third-party aggregator to consolidate models from all organizations (multilevel FL), but this requires trusting an entity that may be biased or unreliable. Alternatively, organizations can bypass a third party by sharing their local models directly, which requires significant computational resources for validation. Both approaches reflect a fundamental trade-off between trust and resource constraints, with neither offering an ideal solution. In this work, we develop a trust-based cross-silo FL framework called UnifyFL, which uses decentralized orchestration and distributed storage. UnifyFL provides flexibility to the participating organizations and presents synchronous and asynchronous modes to handle stragglers. Our evaluation on a diverse testbed shows that UnifyFL achieves a performance comparable to the ideal multilevel centralized FL while allowing trust and optimal use of resources.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18916.pdf,"Sarang S, Druva Dhakshinamoorthy, Aditya Shiva Sharma, Yuvraj Singh Bhadauria, Siddharth Chaitra Vivek, Arihant Bansal, Arnab K.

Provable algorithms for multi-reference alignment over $\SO(2)$,"The multi-reference alignment (MRA) problem involves reconstructing a signal from multiple noisy observations, each transformed by a random group element. In this paper, we focus on the group \(\mathrm{SO}(2)\) of in-plane rotations and propose two computationally efficient algorithms with theoretical guarantees for accurate signal recovery under a non-uniform distribution over the group. The first algorithm exploits the spectral properties of the second moment of the data, while the second utilizes the frequency marching principle. Both algorithms achieve the optimal estimation rate in high-noise regimes, marking a significant advancement in the development of computationally efficient and statistically optimal methods for estimation problems over groups.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19140.pdf,"Gil Drozatz, Tamir Bendory, Nir Sharon",math.NA
Semantic-Aligned Learning with Collaborative Refinement for Unsupervised VI-ReID,"Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USL-VI-ReID) seeks to match pedestrian images of the same individual across different modalities without human annotations for model learning. Previous methods unify pseudo-labels of cross-modality images through label association algorithms and then design contrastive learning framework for global feature learning. However, these methods overlook the cross-modality variations in feature representation and pseudo-label distributions brought by fine-grained patterns. This insight results in insufficient modality-shared learning when only global features are optimized. To address this issue, we propose a Semantic-Aligned Learning with Collaborative Refinement (SALCR) framework, which builds up optimization objective for specific fine-grained patterns emphasized by each modality, thereby achieving complementary alignment between the label distributions of different modalities. Specifically, we first introduce a Dual Association with Global Learning (DAGI) module to unify the pseudo-labels of cross-modality instances in a bi-directional manner. Afterward, a Fine-Grained Semantic-Aligned Learning (FGSAL) module is carried out to explore part-level semantic-aligned patterns emphasized by each modality from cross-modality instances. Optimization objective is then formulated based on the semantic-aligned features and their corresponding label space. To alleviate the side-effects arising from noisy pseudo-labels, we propose a Global-Part Collaborative Refinement (GPCR) module to mine reliable positive sample sets for the global and part features dynamically and optimize the inter-instance relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves superior performances to state-of-the-art methods.

Putting Fair Division on the Map,"The fair division of indivisible goods is not only a subject of theoretical research, but also an important problem in practice, with solutions being offered on several online platforms. Little is known, however, about the characteristics of real-world allocation instances and how they compare to synthetic instances. Using dimensionality reduction, we compute a map of allocation instances: a 2-dimensional embedding such that an instance's location on the map is predictive of the instance's origin and other key instance features. Because the axes of this map closely align with the utility matrix's two largest singular values, we define a second, explicit map, which we theoretically characterize.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.20161.pdf,"Paula B\""ohm, Robert Bredereck, Paul G\""olz, Andrzej Kaczmarczyk, Stanis{\l}aw Szufa",cs.GT
PhysicsFC: Learning User-Controlled Skills for a Physics-Based Football Player Controller,"We propose PhysicsFC, a method for controlling physically simulated football player characters to perform a variety of football skills--such as dribbling, trapping, moving, and kicking--based on user input, while seamlessly transitioning between these skills. Our skill-specific policies, which generate latent variables for each football skill, are trained using an existing physics-based motion embedding model that serves as a foundation for reproducing football motions. Key features include a tailored reward design for the Dribble policy, a two-phase reward structure combined with projectile dynamics-based initialization for the Trap policy, and a Data-Embedded Goal-Conditioned Latent Guidance (DEGCL) method for the Move policy. Using the trained skill policies, the proposed football player finite state machine (PhysicsFC FSM) allows users to interactively control the character. To ensure smooth and agile transitions between skill policies, as defined in the FSM, we introduce the Skill Transition-Based Initialization (STI), which is applied during the training of each skill policy. We develop several interactive scenarios to showcase PhysicsFC's effectiveness, including competitive trapping and dribbling, give-and-go plays, and 11v11 football games, where multiple PhysicsFC agents produce natural and controllable physics-based football player behaviors. Quantitative evaluations further validate the performance of individual skill policies and the transitions between them, using the presented metrics and experimental designs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21216.pdf,"Minsu Kim, Eunho Jung, Yoonsang Lee",cs.GR
ABG-NAS: Adaptive Bayesian Genetic Neural Architecture Search for Graph Representation Learning,"Effective and efficient graph representation learning is essential for enabling critical downstream tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and subgraph search. However, existing graph neural network (GNN) architectures often struggle to adapt to diverse and complex graph structures, limiting their ability to produce structure-aware and task-discriminative representations. To address this challenge, we propose ABG-NAS, a novel framework for automated graph neural network architecture search tailored for efficient graph representation learning. ABG-NAS encompasses three key components: a Comprehensive Architecture Search Space (CASS), an Adaptive Genetic Optimization Strategy (AGOS), and a Bayesian-Guided Tuning Module (BGTM). CASS systematically explores diverse propagation (P) and transformation (T) operations, enabling the discovery of GNN architectures capable of capturing intricate graph characteristics. AGOS dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, ensuring search efficiency and preserving solution diversity. BGTM further optimizes hyperparameters periodically, enhancing the scalability and robustness of the resulting architectures. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets (Cora, PubMed, Citeseer, and CoraFull) demonstrate that ABG-NAS consistently outperforms both manually designed GNNs and state-of-the-art neural architecture search (NAS) methods. These results highlight the potential of ABG-NAS to advance graph representation learning by providing scalable and adaptive solutions for diverse graph structures.

Mining and Intervention of Social Networks Information Cocoon Based on Multi-Layer Network Community Detection,"With the rapid development of information technology and the widespread utilization of recommendation algorithms, users are able to access information more conveniently, while the content they receive tends to be homogeneous. Homogeneous viewpoints and preferences tend to cluster users into sub-networks, leading to group polarization and increasing the likelihood of forming information cocoons. This paper aims to handle information cocoon phenomena in debates on social media. In order to investigate potential user connections, we construct a double-layer network that incorporates two dimensions: relational ties and feature-based similarity between users. Based on the structure of the multi-layer network, we promote two graph auto-encoder (GAE) based community detection algorithms, which can be applied to the partition and determination of information cocoons. This paper tests these two algorithms on Cora, Citeseer, and synthetic datasets, comparing them with existing multi-layer network unsupervised community detection algorithms. Numerical experiments illustrate that the algorithms proposed in this paper significantly improve prediction accuracy indicator NMI (normalized mutual information) and network topology indicator Q. Additionally, an influence-based intervention measure on which algorithms can operate is proposed. Through the Markov states transition model, we simulate the intervention effects, which illustrate that our community detection algorithms play a vital role in partitioning and determining information cocoons. Simultaneously, our intervention strategy alleviates the polarization of viewpoints and the formation of information cocoons with minimal intervention effort.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21357.pdf,"Suwen Yang, Lei Shi",cs.SI

Iterative Tool Usage Exploration for Multimodal Agents via Step-wise Preference Tuning,"Multimodal agents, which integrate a controller (e.g., a large language model) with external tools, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tackling complex tasks. However, existing agents need to collect a large number of expert data for fine-tuning to adapt to new environments. In this paper, we propose an online self-exploration method for multimodal agents, namely SPORT, via step-wise preference optimization to refine the trajectories of agents, which automatically generates tasks and learns from solving the generated tasks, without any expert annotation. SPORT operates through four iterative components: task synthesis, step sampling, step verification, and preference tuning. First, we synthesize multi-modal tasks using language models. Then, we introduce a novel search scheme, where step sampling and step verification are executed alternately to solve each generated task. We employ a verifier to provide AI feedback to construct step-wise preference data. The data is subsequently used to update the controller's policy through preference tuning, producing a SPORT Agent. By interacting with real environments, the SPORT Agent evolves into a more refined and capable system. Evaluation in the GTA and GAIA benchmarks show that the SPORT Agent achieves 6.41\% and 3.64\% improvements, underscoring the generalization and effectiveness introduced by our method.

Real-World Gaps in AI Governance Research,"Drawing on 1,178 safety and reliability papers from 9,439 generative AI papers (January 2020 - March 2025), we compare research outputs of leading AI companies (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI) and AI universities (CMU, MIT, NYU, Stanford, UC Berkeley, and University of Washington). We find that corporate AI research increasingly concentrates on pre-deployment areas -- model alignment and testing & evaluation -- while attention to deployment-stage issues such as model bias has waned. Significant research gaps exist in high-risk deployment domains, including healthcare, finance, misinformation, persuasive and addictive features, hallucinations, and copyright.

J-PARSE: Jacobian-based Projection Algorithm for Resolving Singularities Effectively in Inverse Kinematic Control of Serial Manipulators,"J-PARSE is a method for smooth first-order inverse kinematic control of a serial manipulator near kinematic singularities. The commanded end-effector velocity is interpreted component-wise, according to the available mobility in each dimension of the task space. First, a substitute ""Safety"" Jacobian matrix is created, keeping the aspect ratio of the manipulability ellipsoid above a threshold value. The desired motion is then projected onto non-singular and singular directions, and the latter projection scaled down by a factor informed by the threshold value. A right-inverse of the non-singular Safety Jacobian is applied to the modified command. In the absence of joint limits and collisions, this ensures smooth transition into and out of low-rank poses, guaranteeing asymptotic stability for target poses within the workspace, and stability for those outside. Velocity control with J-PARSE is benchmarked against the Least-Squares and Damped Least-Squares inversions of the Jacobian, and shows high accuracy in reaching and leaving singular target poses. By expanding the available workspace of manipulators, the method finds applications in servoing, teleoperation, and learning.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00306.pdf,"Shivani Guptasarma, Matthew Strong, Honghao Zhen, Monroe Kennedy III",cs.RO
HeAL3D: Heuristical-enhanced Active Learning for 3D Object Detection,"Active Learning has proved to be a relevant approach to perform sample selection for training models for Autonomous Driving. Particularly, previous works on active learning for 3D object detection have shown that selection of samples in uncontrolled scenarios is challenging. Furthermore, current approaches focus exclusively on the theoretical aspects of the sample selection problem but neglect the practical insights that can be obtained from the extensive literature and application of 3D detection models. In this paper, we introduce HeAL (Heuristical-enhanced Active Learning for 3D Object Detection) which integrates those heuristical features together with Localization and Classification to deliver the most contributing samples to the model's training. In contrast to previous works, our approach integrates heuristical features such as object distance and point-quantity to estimate the uncertainty, which enhance the usefulness of selected samples to train detection models. Our quantitative evaluation on KITTI shows that HeAL presents competitive mAP with respect to the State-of-the-Art, and achieves the same mAP as the full-supervised baseline with only 24% of the samples.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00507.pdf,"Esteban Rivera, Surya Prabhakaran, Markus Lienkamp",cs.CV
Robotic Visual Instruction,"Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot interaction. However, its inherent lack of spatial precision introduces challenges for robotic task definition such as ambiguity and verbosity. Moreover, in some public settings where quiet is required, such as libraries or hospitals, verbal communication with robots is inappropriate. To address these limitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel paradigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic representation. RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into human-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows, circles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation. To enable robots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we present Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for RoVI-conditioned policies. This approach leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from 2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable 3D action sequences. We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K instances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment,enabling them to effectively learn RoVI capabilities. Our approach is rigorously validated across 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating significant generalization capability. Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success rate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step actions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements.

Entropy Heat-Mapping: Localizing GPT-Based OCR Errors with Sliding-Window Shannon Analysis,"Vision-language models such as OpenAI GPT-4o can transcribe mathematical documents directly from images, yet their token-level confidence signals are seldom used to pinpoint local recognition mistakes. We present an entropy-heat-mapping proof-of-concept that turns per-token Shannon entropy into a visual ''uncertainty landscape''. By scanning the entropy sequence with a fixed-length sliding window, we obtain hotspots that are likely to contain OCR errors such as missing symbols, mismatched braces, or garbled prose. Using a small, curated set of scanned research pages rendered at several resolutions, we compare the highlighted hotspots with the actual transcription errors produced by GPT-4o. Our analysis shows that the vast majority of true errors are indeed concentrated inside the high-entropy regions. This study demonstrates--in a minimally engineered setting--that sliding-window entropy can serve as a practical, lightweight aid for post-editing GPT-based OCR. All code and annotation guidelines are released to encourage replication and further research.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00746.pdf,Alexei Kaltchenko,cs.CV
Should AI Mimic People?

However, little is known about how people perceive the suggestions these tools provide. In this paper, we investigate how Black American users perceive AISWT, motivated by prior findings in natural language processing that highlight how the underlying large language models can contain racial biases. Using interviews and observational user studies with 13 Black American users of AISWT, we found a strong tradeoff between the perceived benefits of using AISWT to enhance their writing style and feeling like ""it wasn't built for us"". Specifically, participants reported AISWT's failure to recognize commonly used names and expressions in African American Vernacular English, experiencing its corrections as hurtful and alienating and fearing it might further minoritize their culture. We end with a reflection on the tension between AISWT that fail to include Black American culture and language, and AISWT that attempt to mimic it, with attention to accuracy, authenticity, and the production of social difference.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00821.pdf,"Jeffrey Basoah, Jay L.

How Transformers Learn Regular Language Recognition: A Theoretical Study on Training Dynamics and Implicit Bias,"Language recognition tasks are fundamental in natural language processing (NLP) and have been widely used to benchmark the performance of large language models (LLMs). These tasks also play a crucial role in explaining the working mechanisms of transformers. In this work, we focus on two representative tasks in the category of regular language recognition, known as `even pairs' and `parity check', the aim of which is to determine whether the occurrences of certain subsequences in a given sequence are even. Our goal is to explore how a one-layer transformer, consisting of an attention layer followed by a linear layer, learns to solve these tasks by theoretically analyzing its training dynamics under gradient descent. While even pairs can be solved directly by a one-layer transformer, parity check need to be solved by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT), either into the inference stage of a transformer well-trained for the even pairs task, or into the training of a one-layer transformer. For both problems, our analysis shows that the joint training of attention and linear layers exhibits two distinct phases. In the first phase, the attention layer grows rapidly, mapping data sequences into separable vectors. In the second phase, the attention layer becomes stable, while the linear layer grows logarithmically and approaches in direction to a max-margin hyperplane that correctly separates the attention layer outputs into positive and negative samples, and the loss decreases at a rate of $O(1/t)$. Our experiments validate those theoretical results.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00926.pdf,"Ruiquan Huang, Yingbin Liang, Jing Yang",cs.LG

SemSpaceFL: A Collaborative Hierarchical Federated Learning Framework for Semantic Communication in 6G LEO Satellites,"The advent of the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, enhanced by artificial intelligence, promises ubiquitous connectivity through Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. These satellites are capable of collecting vast amounts of geographically diverse and real-time data, which can be immensely valuable for training intelligent models. However, limited inter-satellite communication and data privacy constraints hinder data collection on a single server for training. Therefore, we propose SemSpaceFL, a novel hierarchical federated learning (HFL) framework for LEO satellite networks, with integrated semantic communication capabilities. Our framework introduces a two-tier aggregation architecture where satellite models are first aggregated at regional gateways before final consolidation at a cloud server, which explicitly accounts for satellite mobility patterns and energy constraints. The key innovation lies in our novel aggregation approach, which dynamically adjusts the contribution of each satellite based on its trajectory and association with different gateways, which ensures stable model convergence despite the highly dynamic nature of LEO constellations. To further enhance communication efficiency, we incorporate semantic encoding-decoding techniques trained through the proposed HFL framework, which enables intelligent data compression while maintaining signal integrity. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed aggregation strategy achieves superior performance and faster convergence compared to existing benchmarks, while effectively managing the challenges of satellite mobility and energy limitations in dynamic LEO networks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00966.pdf,"Loc X.

Distilling Two-Timed Flow Models by Separately Matching Initial and Terminal Velocities,"A flow matching model learns a time-dependent vector field $v_t(x)$ that generates a probability path $\{ p_t \}_{0 \leq t \leq 1}$ that interpolates between a well-known noise distribution ($p_0$) and the data distribution ($p_1$). It can be distilled into a two-timed flow model (TTFM) $\phi_{s,x}(t)$ that can transform a sample belonging to the distribution at an initial time $s$ to another belonging to the distribution at a terminal time $t$ in one function evaluation. We present a new loss function for TTFM distillation called the \emph{initial/terminal velocity matching} (ITVM) loss that extends the Lagrangian Flow Map Distillation (LFMD) loss proposed by Boffi et al. by adding redundant terms to match the initial velocities at time $s$, removing the derivative from the terminal velocity term at time $t$, and using a version of the model under training, stabilized by exponential moving averaging (EMA), to compute the target terminal average velocity. Preliminary experiments show that our loss leads to better few-step generation performance on multiple types of datasets and model architectures over baselines.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01169.pdf,"Pramook Khungurn, Pratch Piyawongwisal, Sira Sriswasdi, Supasorn Suwajanakorn",cs.LG

We compare these filtrations in applications to networks, system signatures, and sensitivity analysis.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01416.pdf,"Fatemeh Mohammadi, Eduardo S\'aenz-de-Cabez\'on, Henry Wynn",cs.DM
Evaluating Frontier Models for Stealth and Situational Awareness,"Recent work has demonstrated the plausibility of frontier AI models scheming -- knowingly and covertly pursuing an objective misaligned with its developer's intentions. Such behavior could be very hard to detect, and if present in future advanced systems, could pose severe loss of control risk. It is therefore important for AI developers to rule out harm from scheming prior to model deployment. In this paper, we present a suite of scheming reasoning evaluations measuring two types of reasoning capabilities that we believe are prerequisites for successful scheming: First, we propose five evaluations of ability to reason about and circumvent oversight (stealth). Second, we present eleven evaluations for measuring a model's ability to instrumentally reason about itself, its environment and its deployment (situational awareness). We demonstrate how these evaluations can be used as part of a scheming inability safety case: a model that does not succeed on these evaluations is almost certainly incapable of causing severe harm via scheming in real deployment. We run our evaluations on current frontier models and find that none of them show concerning levels of either situational awareness or stealth.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01420.pdf,"Mary Phuong, Roland S.

A Multi-Granularity Retrieval Framework for Visually-Rich Documents,"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have predominantly focused on text-based retrieval, limiting their effectiveness in handling visually-rich documents that encompass text, images, tables, and charts. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified multi-granularity multimodal retrieval framework tailored for two benchmark tasks: MMDocIR and M2KR. Our approach integrates hierarchical encoding strategies, modality-aware retrieval mechanisms, and vision-language model (VLM)-based candidate filtering to effectively capture and utilize the complex interdependencies between textual and visual modalities. By leveraging off-the-shelf vision-language models and implementing a training-free hybrid retrieval strategy, our framework demonstrates robust performance without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. Experimental evaluations reveal that incorporating layout-aware search and VLM-based candidate verification significantly enhances retrieval accuracy, achieving a top performance score of 65.56. This work underscores the potential of scalable and reproducible solutions in advancing multimodal document retrieval systems.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01457.pdf,"Mingjun Xu, Zehui Wang, Hengxing Cai, Renxin Zhong",cs.IR
A Decision-Focused Predict-then-Bid Framework for Strategic Energy Storage,"This paper introduces a novel decision-focused framework for energy storage arbitrage bidding. Inspired by the bidding process for energy storage in electricity markets, we propose a predict-then-bid end-to-end method incorporating the storage arbitrage optimization and market clearing models. This is achieved through a tri-layer framework that combines a price prediction layer with a two-stage optimization problem: an energy storage optimization layer and a market-clearing optimization layer. We leverage the implicit function theorem for gradient computation in the first optimization layer and incorporate a perturbation-based approach into the decision-focused loss function to ensure differentiability in the market-clearing layer. Numerical experiments using electricity market data from New York demonstrate that our bidding design substantially outperforms existing methods, achieving the highest profits and showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01551.pdf,"Ming Yi, Yiqian Wu, Saud Alghumayjan, James Anderson, Bolun Xu",eess.SY
Understanding and Exploiting Plasticity for Non-stationary Network Resource Adaptation,"Adapting to non-stationary network conditions presents significant challenges for resource adaptation. However, current solutions primarily rely on stationary assumptions. While data-driven reinforcement learning approaches offer promising solutions for handling network dynamics, our systematic investigation reveals a critical limitation: neural networks suffer from plasticity loss, significantly impeding their ability to adapt to evolving network conditions. Through theoretical analysis of neural propagation mechanisms, we demonstrate that existing dormant neuron metrics inadequately characterize neural plasticity loss. To address this limitation, we have developed the Silent Neuron theory, which provides a more comprehensive framework for understanding plasticity degradation. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose the Reset Silent Neuron (ReSiN), which preserves neural plasticity through strategic neuron resets guided by both forward and backward propagation states. In our implementation of an adaptive video streaming system, ReSiN has shown significant improvements over existing solutions, achieving up to 168% higher bitrate and 108% better quality of experience (QoE) while maintaining comparable smoothness. Furthermore, ReSiN consistently outperforms in stationary environments, demonstrating its robust adaptability across different network conditions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01584.pdf,"Zhiqiang He, Zhi Liu",cs.LG
Exploring the Role of Diversity in Example Selection for In-Context Learning,"In-Context Learning (ICL) has gained prominence due to its ability to perform tasks without requiring extensive training data and its robustness to noisy labels. A typical ICL workflow involves selecting localized examples relevant to a given input using sparse or dense embedding-based similarity functions. However, relying solely on similarity-based selection may introduce topical biases in the retrieved contexts, potentially leading to suboptimal downstream performance. We posit that reranking the retrieved context to enhance topical diversity can improve downstream task performance. To achieve this, we leverage maximum marginal relevance (MMR) which balances topical similarity with inter-example diversity. Our experimental results demonstrate that diversifying the selected examples leads to consistent improvements in downstream performance across various context sizes and similarity functions. The implementation of our approach is made available at https://github.com/janak11111/Diverse-ICL.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01842.pdf,"Janak Kapuriya, Manit Kaushik, Debasis Ganguly, Sumit Bhatia",cs.IR
ReLI: A Language-Agnostic Approach to Human-Robot Interaction,"Adapting autonomous agents to industrial, domestic, and other daily tasks is currently gaining momentum. However, in the global or cross-lingual application contexts, ensuring effective interaction with the environment and executing unrestricted human task-specified instructions in diverse languages remains an unsolved problem. To address this challenge, we propose ReLI, a language-agnostic framework designed to enable autonomous agents to converse naturally, semantically reason about the environment, and to perform downstream tasks, regardless of the task instruction's linguistic origin. First, we ground large-scale pre-trained foundation models and transform them into language-to-action models that can directly provide common-sense reasoning and high-level robot control through natural, free-flow human-robot conversational interactions. Further, we perform cross-lingual grounding of the models to ensure that ReLI generalises across the global languages. To demonstrate the ReLI's robustness, we conducted extensive simulated and real-world experiments on various short- and long-horizon tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot spatial navigation, scene information retrieval, and query-oriented tasks. We benchmarked the performance on 140 languages involving over 70K multi-turn conversations. On average, ReLI achieved over 90%$\pm$0.2 accuracy in cross-lingual instruction parsing and task execution success rates. These results demonstrate the ReLI's potential to enhance natural human-robot interaction in the real world while championing linguistic diversity. Demonstrations and resources will be publicly available at https://linusnep.github.io/ReLI/.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01862.pdf,"Linus Nwankwo, Bjoern Ellensohn, Ozan \""Ozdenizci, Elmar Rueckert",cs.RO

EnsembleCI: Ensemble Learning for Carbon Intensity Forecasting,"Carbon intensity (CI) measures the average carbon emissions generated per unit of electricity, making it a crucial metric for quantifying and managing the environmental impact. Accurate CI predictions are vital for minimizing carbon footprints, yet the state-of-the-art method (CarbonCast) falls short due to its inability to address regional variability and lack of adaptability. To address these limitations, we introduce EnsembleCI, an adaptive, end-to-end ensemble learning-based approach for CI forecasting. EnsembleCI combines weighted predictions from multiple sublearners, offering enhanced flexibility and regional adaptability. In evaluations across 11 regional grids, EnsembleCI consistently surpasses CarbonCast, achieving the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in almost all grids and improving prediction accuracy by an average of 19.58%. While performance still varies across grids due to inherent regional diversity, EnsembleCI reduces variability and exhibits greater robustness in long-term forecasting compared to CarbonCast and identifies region-specific key features, underscoring its interpretability and practical relevance. These findings position EnsembleCI as a more accurate and reliable solution for CI forecasting.

A Synergistic Framework of Nonlinear Acoustic Computing and Reinforcement Learning for Real-World Human-Robot Interaction,"This paper introduces a novel framework integrating nonlinear acoustic computing and reinforcement learning to enhance advanced human-robot interaction under complex noise and reverberation. Leveraging physically informed wave equations (e.g., Westervelt, KZK), the approach captures higher-order phenomena such as harmonic generation and shock formation. By embedding these models in a reinforcement learning-driven control loop, the system adaptively optimizes key parameters (e.g., absorption, beamforming) to mitigate multipath interference and non-stationary noise. Experimental evaluations, covering far-field localization, weak signal detection, and multilingual speech recognition, demonstrate that this hybrid strategy surpasses traditional linear methods and purely data-driven baselines, achieving superior noise suppression, minimal latency, and robust accuracy in demanding real-world scenarios. The proposed system demonstrates broad application prospects in AI hardware, robot, machine audition, artificial audition, and brain-machine interfaces.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01998.pdf,"Xiaoliang Chen (SoundAI Technology Co., Ltd), Xin Yu (SoundAI Technology Co., Ltd), Le Chang (SoundAI Technology Co., Ltd), Yunhe Huang (SoundAI Technology Co., Ltd), Jiashuai He (SoundAI Technology Co., Ltd), Shibo Zhang (SoundAI Technology Co., Ltd), Jin Li (SoundAI Technology Co., Ltd), Likai Lin (SoundAI Technology Co., Ltd), Ziyu Zeng (SoundAI Technology Co., Ltd), Xianling Tu (SoundAI Technology Co., Ltd), Shuyu Zhang (SoundAI Technology Co., Ltd)",cs.RO
"RTV-Bench: Benchmarking MLLM Continuous Perception, Understanding and Reasoning through Real-Time Video","Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly excel at perception, understanding, and reasoning. However, current benchmarks inadequately evaluate their ability to perform these tasks continuously in dynamic, real-world environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce RTV-Bench, a fine-grained benchmark for MLLM real-time video analysis. RTV-Bench uses three key principles: (1) Multi-Timestamp Question Answering (MTQA), where answers evolve with scene changes; (2) Hierarchical Question Structure, combining basic and advanced queries; and (3) Multi-dimensional Evaluation, assessing the ability of continuous perception, understanding, and reasoning. RTV-Bench contains 552 diverse videos (167.2 hours) and 4,631 high-quality QA pairs. We evaluated leading MLLMs, including proprietary (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0), open-source offline (Qwen2.5-VL, VideoLLaMA3), and open-source real-time (VITA-1.5, InternLM-XComposer2.5-OmniLive) models. Experiment results show open-source real-time models largely outperform offline ones but still trail top proprietary models. Our analysis also reveals that larger model size or higher frame sampling rates do not significantly boost RTV-Bench performance, sometimes causing slight decreases. This underscores the need for better model architectures optimized for video stream processing and long sequences to advance real-time video analysis with MLLMs. Our benchmark toolkit is available at: https://github.com/LJungang/RTV-Bench.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02064.pdf,"Shuhang Xun, Sicheng Tao, Jungang Li, Yibo Shi, Zhixin Lin, Zhanhui Zhu, Yibo Yan, Hanqian Li, Linghao Zhang, Shikang Wang, Yixin Liu, Hanbo Zhang, Ying Ma, Xuming Hu",cs.CV
Adversarial Cooperative Rationalization: The Risk of Spurious Correlations in Even Clean Datasets,"This study investigates the self-rationalization framework constructed with a cooperative game, where a generator initially extracts the most informative segment from raw input, and a subsequent predictor utilizes the selected subset for its input. The generator and predictor are trained collaboratively to maximize prediction accuracy. In this paper, we first uncover a potential caveat: such a cooperative game could unintentionally introduce a sampling bias during rationale extraction. Specifically, the generator might inadvertently create an incorrect correlation between the selected rationale candidate and the label, even when they are semantically unrelated in the original dataset. Subsequently, we elucidate the origins of this bias using both detailed theoretical analysis and empirical evidence. Our findings suggest a direction for inspecting these correlations through attacks, based on which we further introduce an instruction to prevent the predictor from learning the correlations. Through experiments on six text classification datasets and two graph classification datasets using three network architectures (GRUs, BERT, and GCN), we show that our method not only significantly outperforms recent rationalization methods, but also achieves comparable or even better results than a representative LLM (llama3.1-8b-instruct).",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02118.pdf,"Wei Liu, Zhongyu Niu, Lang Gao, Zhiying Deng, Jun Wang, Haozhao Wang, Ruixuan Li",cs.AI
Efficient Multivariate Time Series Forecasting via Calibrated Language Models with Privileged Knowledge Distillation,"Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) endeavors to predict future observations given historical data, playing a crucial role in time series data management systems. With advancements in large language models (LLMs), recent studies employ textual prompt tuning to infuse the knowledge of LLMs into MTSF. However, the deployment of LLMs often suffers from low efficiency during the inference phase. To address this problem, we introduce TimeKD, an efficient MTSF framework that leverages the calibrated language models and privileged knowledge distillation. TimeKD aims to generate high-quality future representations from the proposed cross-modality teacher model and cultivate an effective student model. The cross-modality teacher model adopts calibrated language models (CLMs) with ground truth prompts, motivated by the paradigm of Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI). In addition, we design a subtractive cross attention (SCA) mechanism to refine these representations. To cultivate an effective student model, we propose an innovative privileged knowledge distillation (PKD) mechanism including correlation and feature distillation. PKD enables the student to replicate the teacher's behavior while minimizing their output discrepancy. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of the proposed TimeKD.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02138.pdf,"Chenxi Liu, Hao Miao, Qianxiong Xu, Shaowen Zhou, Cheng Long, Yan Zhao, Ziyue Li, Rui Zhao",cs.LG
Think on your Feet: Adaptive Thinking via Reinforcement Learning for Social Agents,"Effective social intelligence simulation requires language agents to dynamically adjust reasoning depth, a capability notably absent in current approaches. While existing methods either lack this kind of reasoning capability or enforce uniform long chain-of-thought reasoning across all scenarios, resulting in excessive token usage and inappropriate social simulation. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{L}$earning ($\textbf{AML}$) that strategically selects from four thinking modes (intuitive reaction $\rightarrow$ deep contemplation) based on real-time context. Our framework's core innovation, the $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{M}$ode $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{AMPO}$) algorithm, introduces three key advancements over existing methods: (1) Multi-granular thinking mode design, (2) Context-aware mode switching across social interaction, and (3) Token-efficient reasoning via depth-adaptive processing. Extensive experiments on social intelligence tasks confirm that AML achieves 15.6% higher task performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our method outperforms GRPO by 7.0% with 32.8% shorter reasoning chains. These results demonstrate that context-sensitive thinking mode selection, as implemented in AMPO, enables more human-like adaptive reasoning than GRPO's fixed-depth approach.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02156.pdf,"Minzheng Wang, Yongbin Li, Haobo Wang, Xinghua Zhang, Nan Xu, Bingli Wu, Fei Huang, Haiyang Yu, Wenji Mao",cs.CL
"Grassroots Democratic Federation: Fair Governance of Large-Scale, Decentralized, Sovereign Digital Communities","Grassroots Democratic Federation aims to address the egalitarian formation and the fair democratic governance of large-scale, decentralized, sovereign digital communities, the size of the EU, the US, existing social networks, and even humanity at large. A grassroots democratic federation evolves via the grassroots formation of digital communities and their consensual federation. Such digital communities may form according to geography, jurisdiction, affiliations, relations, interests, or causes. Small communities (say up to 100 members) govern themselves; larger communities -- no matter how large -- are governed by a small assembly elected by sortition among its members. Earlier work on Grassroots Democratic Federation explored the fair sortition of the assemblies of a federation in a static setting: Given a federation, populate its assemblies with members satisfying ex ante and ex post fairness conditions on the participation of members of a community in its assembly, and on the representation of child communities in the assembly of their parent community.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02208.pdf,"Ehud Shapiro, Nimrod Talmon",cs.DC

Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Z-Score Gradient Filtering for Neural Networks,"Generalizing well in deep neural networks remains a core challenge, particularly due to their tendency to converge to sharp minima that degrade robustness. Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) mitigates this by seeking flatter minima but perturbs parameters using the full gradient, which can include statistically insignificant directions. We propose ZSharp, a simple yet effective extension to SAM that applies layer-wise Z-score normalization followed by percentile-based filtering to retain only statistically significant gradient components. This selective perturbation aligns updates with curvature-sensitive directions, enhancing generalization without requiring architectural changes. ZSharp introduces only one additional hyperparameter, the percentile threshold, and remains fully compatible with existing SAM variants. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet using ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that ZSharp consistently outperforms SAM and its variants in test accuracy, particularly on deeper and transformer-based models. These results demonstrate that ZSharp is a principled and lightweight improvement for sharpness-aware optimization.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02369.pdf,Juyoung Yun,cs.LG
EntroLLM: Entropy Encoded Weight Compression for Efficient Large Language Model Inference on Edge Devices,"Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across various tasks, but their large storage and computational requirements constrain their deployment on edge devices. To address this, we propose EntroLLM, a novel compression framework that integrates mixed quantization with entropy coding to reduce storage overhead while maintaining model accuracy. Our method applies a layer-wise mixed quantization scheme - choosing between symmetric and asymmetric quantization based on individual layer weight distributions - to optimize compressibility. We then employ Huffman encoding for lossless compression of the quantized weights, significantly reducing memory bandwidth requirements. Furthermore, we introduce parallel Huffman decoding, which enables efficient retrieval of encoded weights during inference, ensuring minimal latency impact. Our experiments on edge-compatible LLMs, including smolLM-1.7B-Instruct, phi3-mini-4k-Instruct, and mistral-7B-Instruct, demonstrate that EntroLLM achieves up to $30\%$ storage reduction compared to uint8 models and up to $65%$ storage reduction compared to uint4 models, while preserving perplexity and accuracy, on language benchmark tasks. We further show that our method enables $31.9\%$ - $146.6\%$ faster inference throughput on memory-bandwidth-limited edge devices, such as NVIDIA Jetson P3450, by reducing the required data movement. The proposed approach requires no additional re-training and is fully compatible with existing post-training quantization methods, making it a practical solution for edge LLMs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02380.pdf,"Arnab Sanyal, Prithwish Mukherjee, Gourav Datta, Sandeep P.

Advancing Constrained Monotonic Neural Networks: Achieving Universal Approximation Beyond Bounded Activations,"Conventional techniques for imposing monotonicity in MLPs by construction involve the use of non-negative weight constraints and bounded activation functions, which pose well-known optimization challenges. In this work, we generalize previous theoretical results, showing that MLPs with non-negative weight constraint and activations that saturate on alternating sides are universal approximators for monotonic functions. Additionally, we show an equivalence between the saturation side in the activations and the sign of the weight constraint. This connection allows us to prove that MLPs with convex monotone activations and non-positive constrained weights also qualify as universal approximators, in contrast to their non-negative constrained counterparts. Our results provide theoretical grounding to the empirical effectiveness observed in previous works while leading to possible architectural simplification. Moreover, to further alleviate the optimization difficulties, we propose an alternative formulation that allows the network to adjust its activations according to the sign of the weights. This eliminates the requirement for weight reparameterization, easing initialization and improving training stability. Experimental evaluation reinforces the validity of the theoretical results, showing that our novel approach compares favourably to traditional monotonic architectures.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02537.pdf,"Davide Sartor, Alberto Sinigaglia, Gian Antonio Susto",cs.LG
Robust Duality Learning for Unsupervised Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification,"Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (UVI-ReID) aims to retrieve pedestrian images across different modalities without costly annotations, but faces challenges due to the modality gap and lack of supervision. Existing methods often adopt self-training with clustering-generated pseudo-labels but implicitly assume these labels are always correct. In practice, however, this assumption fails due to inevitable pseudo-label noise, which hinders model learning. To address this, we introduce a new learning paradigm that explicitly considers Pseudo-Label Noise (PLN), characterized by three key challenges: noise overfitting, error accumulation, and noisy cluster correspondence. To this end, we propose a novel Robust Duality Learning framework (RoDE) for UVI-ReID to mitigate the effects of noisy pseudo-labels. First, to combat noise overfitting, a Robust Adaptive Learning mechanism (RAL) is proposed to dynamically emphasize clean samples while down-weighting noisy ones. Second, to alleviate error accumulation-where the model reinforces its own mistakes-RoDE employs dual distinct models that are alternately trained using pseudo-labels from each other, encouraging diversity and preventing collapse. However, this dual-model strategy introduces misalignment between clusters across models and modalities, creating noisy cluster correspondence. To resolve this, we introduce Cluster Consistency Matching (CCM), which aligns clusters across models and modalities by measuring cross-cluster similarity. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of RoDE.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02549.pdf,"Yongxiang Li, Yuan Sun, Yang Qin, Dezhong Peng, Xi Peng, Peng Hu",cs.CV

EMORL: Ensemble Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Efficient and Flexible LLM Fine-Tuning,"Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language model (LLM) fine-tuning show promise in addressing multi-objective tasks but still face significant challenges, including complex objective balancing, low training efficiency, poor scalability, and limited explainability. Leveraging ensemble learning principles, we introduce an Ensemble Multi-Objective RL (EMORL) framework that fine-tunes multiple models with individual objectives while optimizing their aggregation after the training to improve efficiency and flexibility. Our method is the first to aggregate the last hidden states of individual models, incorporating contextual information from multiple objectives. This approach is supported by a hierarchical grid search algorithm that identifies optimal weighted combinations. We evaluate EMORL on counselor reflection generation tasks, using text-scoring LLMs to evaluate the generations and provide rewards during RL fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on the PAIR and Psych8k datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of EMORL against existing baselines: significantly lower and more stable training consumption ($17,529\pm 1,650$ data points and $6,573\pm 147.43$ seconds), improved scalability and explainability, and comparable performance across multiple objectives.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02579.pdf,"Lingxiao Kong, Cong Yang, Susanne Neufang, Oya Deniz Beyan, Zeyd Boukhers",cs.CL
GarmentImage: Raster Encoding of Garment Sewing Patterns with Diverse Topologies,"Garment sewing patterns are the design language behind clothing, yet their current vector-based digital representations weren't built with machine learning in mind. Vector-based representation encodes a sewing pattern as a discrete set of panels, each defined as a sequence of lines and curves, stitching information between panels and the placement of each panel around a body. However, this representation causes two major challenges for neural networks: discontinuity in latent space between patterns with different topologies and limited generalization to garments with unseen topologies in the training data. In this work, we introduce GarmentImage, a unified raster-based sewing pattern representation. GarmentImage encodes a garment sewing pattern's geometry, topology and placement into multi-channel regular grids. Machine learning models trained on GarmentImage achieve seamless transitions between patterns with different topologies and show better generalization capabilities compared to models trained on vector-based representation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GarmentImage across three applications: pattern exploration in latent space, text-based pattern editing, and image-to-pattern prediction. The results show that GarmentImage achieves superior performance on these applications using only simple convolutional networks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02592.pdf,"Yuki Tatsukawa, Anran Qi, I-Chao Shen, Takeo Igarashi",cs.GR
MCCD: Multi-Agent Collaboration-based Compositional Diffusion for Complex Text-to-Image Generation,"Diffusion models have shown excellent performance in text-to-image generation. Nevertheless, existing methods often suffer from performance bottlenecks when handling complex prompts that involve multiple objects, characteristics, and relations. Therefore, we propose a Multi-agent Collaboration-based Compositional Diffusion (MCCD) for text-to-image generation for complex scenes. Specifically, we design a multi-agent collaboration-based scene parsing module that generates an agent system comprising multiple agents with distinct tasks, utilizing MLLMs to extract various scene elements effectively. In addition, Hierarchical Compositional diffusion utilizes a Gaussian mask and filtering to refine bounding box regions and enhance objects through region enhancement, resulting in the accurate and high-fidelity generation of complex scenes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our MCCD significantly improves the performance of the baseline models in a training-free manner, providing a substantial advantage in complex scene generation.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02648.pdf,"Mingcheng Li, Xiaolu Hou, Ziyang Liu, Dingkang Yang, Ziyun Qian, Jiawei Chen, Jinjie Wei, Yue Jiang, Qingyao Xu, Lihua Zhang",cs.CV

VGLD: Visually-Guided Linguistic Disambiguation for Monocular Depth Scale Recovery,"We propose a robust method for monocular depth scale recovery. Monocular depth estimation can be divided into two main directions: (1) relative depth estimation, which provides normalized or inverse depth without scale information, and (2) metric depth estimation, which involves recovering depth with absolute scale. To obtain absolute scale information for practical downstream tasks, utilizing textual information to recover the scale of a relative depth map is a highly promising approach. However, since a single image can have multiple descriptions from different perspectives or with varying styles, it has been shown that different textual descriptions can significantly affect the scale recovery process. To address this issue, our method, VGLD, stabilizes the influence of textual information by incorporating high-level semantic information from the corresponding image alongside the textual description. This approach resolves textual ambiguities and robustly outputs a set of linear transformation parameters (scalars) that can be globally applied to the relative depth map, ultimately generating depth predictions with metric-scale accuracy. We validate our method across several popular relative depth models(MiDas, DepthAnything), using both indoor scenes (NYUv2) and outdoor scenes (KITTI). Our results demonstrate that VGLD functions as a universal alignment module when trained on multiple datasets, achieving strong performance even in zero-shot scenarios.

Knowledge Graphs for Enhancing Large Language Models in Entity Disambiguation,"Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as a prominent solution for Natural Language Processing tasks. Notably, they can approach these problems in a zero or few-shot manner, thereby eliminating the need for training or fine-tuning task-specific models. However, LLMs face some challenges, including hallucination and the presence of outdated knowledge or missing information from specific domains in the training data. These problems cannot be easily solved by retraining the models with new data as it is a time-consuming and expensive process. To mitigate these issues, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been proposed as a structured external source of information to enrich LLMs. With this idea, in this work we use KGs to enhance LLMs for zero-shot Entity Disambiguation (ED). For that purpose, we leverage the hierarchical representation of the entities' classes in a KG to gradually prune the candidate space as well as the entities' descriptions to enrich the input prompt with additional factual knowledge. Our evaluation on popular ED datasets shows that the proposed method outperforms non-enhanced and description-only enhanced LLMs, and has a higher degree of adaptability than task-specific models. Furthermore, we conduct an error analysis and discuss the impact of the leveraged KG's semantic expressivity on the ED performance.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02737.pdf,"Gerard Pons, Besim Bilalli, Anna Queralt",cs.LG
dyGRASS: Dynamic Spectral Graph Sparsification via Localized Random Walks on GPUs,"This work presents dyGRASS, an efficient dynamic algorithm for spectral sparsification of large undirected graphs that undergo streaming edge insertions and deletions. At its core, dyGRASS employs a random-walk-based method to efficiently estimate node-to-node distances in both the original graph (for decremental update) and its sparsifier (for incremental update). For incremental updates, dyGRASS enables the identification of spectrally critical edges among the updates to capture the latest structural changes. For decremental updates, dyGRASS facilitates the recovery of important edges from the original graph back into the sparsifier. To further enhance computational efficiency, dyGRASS employs a GPU-based non-backtracking random walk scheme that allows multiple walkers to operate simultaneously across various target updates. This parallelization significantly improves both the performance and scalability of the proposed dyGRASS framework. Our comprehensive experimental evaluations reveal that dyGRASS achieves approximately a 10x speedup compared to the state-of-the-art incremental sparsification (inGRASS) algorithm while eliminating the setup overhead and improving solution quality in incremental spectral sparsification tasks. Moreover, dyGRASS delivers high efficiency and superior solution quality for fully dynamic graph sparsification, accommodating both edge insertions and deletions across a diverse range of graph instances originating from integrated circuit simulations, finite element analysis, and social networks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02741.pdf,"Yihang Yuan, Ali Aghdaei, Zhuo Feng",cs.SI
Towards Application-Specific Evaluation of Vision Models: Case Studies in Ecology and Biology,"Computer vision methods have demonstrated considerable potential to streamline ecological and biological workflows, with a growing number of datasets and models becoming available to the research community. However, these resources focus predominantly on evaluation using machine learning metrics, with relatively little emphasis on how their application impacts downstream analysis. We argue that models should be evaluated using application-specific metrics that directly represent model performance in the context of its final use case. To support this argument, we present two disparate case studies: (1) estimating chimpanzee abundance and density with camera trap distance sampling when using a video-based behaviour classifier and (2) estimating head rotation in pigeons using a 3D posture estimator. We show that even models with strong machine learning performance (e.g., 87% mAP) can yield data that leads to discrepancies in abundance estimates compared to expert-derived data. Similarly, the highest-performing models for posture estimation do not produce the most accurate inferences of gaze direction in pigeons. Motivated by these findings, we call for researchers to integrate application-specific metrics in ecological/biological datasets, allowing for models to be benchmarked in the context of their downstream application and to facilitate better integration of models into application workflows.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02825.pdf,"Alex Hoi Hang Chan, Otto Brookes, Urs Waldmann, Hemal Naik, Iain D.

"Degrees of incomputability, realizability and constructive reverse mathematics","There is a way of assigning a realizability notion to each degree of incomputability.

Characterizing Trust and Resilience in Distributed Consensus for Cyberphysical Systems,"This work considers the problem of resilient consensus where stochastic values of trust between agents are available. Specifically, we derive a unified mathematical framework to characterize convergence, deviation of the consensus from the true consensus value, and expected convergence rate, when there exists additional information of trust between agents. We show that under certain conditions on the stochastic trust values and consensus protocol: 1) almost sure convergence to a common limit value is possible even when malicious agents constitute more than half of the network connectivity, 2) the deviation of the converged limit, from the case where there is no attack, i.e., the true consensus value, can be bounded with probability that approaches 1 exponentially, and 3) correct classification of malicious and legitimate agents can be attained in finite time almost surely. Further, the expected convergence rate decays exponentially as a function of the quality of the trust observations between agents.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.05464.pdf,"Michal Yemini, Angelia Nedi\'c, Andrea Goldsmith, Stephanie Gil",math.OC
Sharp Global Guarantees for Nonconvex Low-rank Recovery in the Noisy Overparameterized Regime,"Recent work established that rank overparameterization eliminates spurious local minima in nonconvex low-rank matrix recovery under the restricted isometry property (RIP). But this does not fully explain the practical success of overparameterization, because real algorithms can still become trapped at nonstrict saddle points (approximate second-order points with arbitrarily small negative curvature) even when all local minima are global. Moreover, the result does not accommodate for noisy measurements, but it is unclear whether such an extension is even possible, in view of the many discontinuous and unintuitive behaviors already known for the overparameterized regime. In this paper, we introduce a novel proof technique that unifies, simplifies, and strengthens two previously competing approaches -- one based on escape directions and the other based on the inexistence of counterexample -- to provide sharp global guarantees in the noisy overparameterized regime. We show, once local minima have been converted into global minima through slight overparameterization, that near-second-order points achieve the same minimax-optimal recovery bounds (up to small constant factors) as significantly more expensive convex approaches. Our results are sharp with respect to the noise level and the solution accuracy, and hold for both the symmetric parameterization $XX^{T}$, as well as the asymmetric parameterization $UV^{T}$ under a balancing regularizer; we demonstrate that the balancing regularizer is indeed necessary.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10790.pdf,Richard Y.

Trinomials and Deterministic Complexity Limits for Real Solving,"We detail an algorithm that -- for all but a $\frac{1}{\Omega(\log(dH))}$ fraction of $f\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ with exactly $3$ monomial terms, degree $d$, and all coefficients in $\{-H,\ldots, H\}$ -- produces an approximate root (in the sense of Smale) for each real root of $f$ in deterministic time $\log^{4+o(1)}(dH)$ in the classical Turing model. (Each approximate root is a rational with logarithmic height $O(\log(dH))$.) The best previous deterministic bit complexity bounds were exponential in $\log d$. We then relate this to Koiran's Trinomial Sign Problem (2017): Decide the sign of a degree $d$ trinomial $f\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ with coefficients in $\{-H,\ldots,H\}$, at a point $r\!\in\!\mathbb{Q}$ of logarithmic height $\log H$, in (deterministic) time $\log^{O(1)}(dH)$. We show that Koiran's Trinomial Sign Problem admits a positive solution, at least for a fraction $1-\frac{1}{\Omega(\log(dH))}$ of the inputs $(f,r)$.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.06115.pdf,"Emma Boniface, Weixun Deng, J.

Truncated LinUCB for Stochastic Linear Bandits,"This paper considers contextual bandits with a finite number of arms, where the contexts are independent and identically distributed $d$-dimensional random vectors, and the expected rewards are linear in both the arm parameters and contexts. The LinUCB algorithm, which is near minimax optimal for related linear bandits, is shown to have a cumulative regret that is suboptimal in both the dimension $d$ and time horizon $T$, due to its over-exploration. A truncated version of LinUCB is proposed and termed ""Tr-LinUCB"", which follows LinUCB up to a truncation time $S$ and performs pure exploitation afterwards. The Tr-LinUCB algorithm is shown to achieve $O(d\log(T))$ regret if $S = Cd\log(T)$ for a sufficiently large constant $C$, and a matching lower bound is established, which shows the rate optimality of Tr-LinUCB in both $d$ and $T$ under a low dimensional regime. Further, if $S = d\log^{\kappa}(T)$ for some $\kappa>1$, the loss compared to the optimal is a multiplicative $\log\log(T)$ factor, which does not depend on $d$. This insensitivity to overshooting in choosing the truncation time of Tr-LinUCB is of practical importance.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.11735.pdf,"Yanglei Song, Meng zhou",stat.ML
Star colouring and locally constrained graph homomorphisms,"We relate star colouring of even-degree regular graphs to the notions of locally constrained graph homomorphisms to the oriented line graph $ \vec{L}(K_q) $ of the complete graph $ K_q $ and to its underlying undirected graph $ L^*(K_q) $. Our results have consequences for locally constrained graph homomorphisms and oriented line graphs in addition to star colouring. We show that $ L^*(H) $ is a 2-lift of the line graph $ L(H) $ for every graph $ H $. Dvo{\v{r}}{\'a}k, Mohar and \v{S}\'amal (J. Graph Theory, 2013) proved that for every 3-regular graph $ G $, the line graph of $ G $ is 4-star colourable if and only if $ G $ admits a locally bijective homomorphism to the cube~$ Q_3 $. We generalise this result as follows: for $ p\geq 2 $, a $ K_{1,p+1} $-free $ 2p $-regular graph $ G $ admits a $ (p+2) $-star colouring if and only if $ G $ admits a locally bijective homomorphism to $ L^*(K_{p+2}) $. As a result, if a $ K_{p+1} $-free $ 2p $-regular graph $ G $ with $ p\geq 2 $ is $ (p+2) $-star colourable, then $ -2 $ and $ p-2 $ are eigenvalues of $ G $. We also prove the following: (i) for $ p\geq 2 $, a $ 2p $-regular graph $ G $ admits a $ (p+2) $-star colouring if and only if $ G $ has an orientation that admits an out-neighbourhood bijective homomorphism to $ \vec{L}(K_{p+2}) $; (ii) the line graph of a 3-regular graph $ G $ is 4-star colourable if and only if $ G $ is bipartite and distance-two 4-colourable; and (iii) it is NP-complete to check whether a planar 4-regular 3-connected graph is 4-star colourable.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00086.pdf,"Cyriac Antony, Shalu M.

Conditions for eigenvalue configurations of two real symmetric matrices,"For two real symmetric matrices, their eigenvalue configuration is the relative arrangement of their eigenvalues on the real line. We consider the following problem: given an eigenvalue configuration, find a condition on the entries of two real symmetric matrices such that they have the given eigenvalue configuration. The problem amounts to finding a finite set of polynomials in the entries of the two matrices (which we call the configuration discriminant), and a way to express the eigenvalue configuration condition as a boolean expression of inequalities on the discriminant polynomials (which we call the configuration-from-sign transform). In this paper, we consider the problem under a mild condition that the two matrices do not share any eigenvalues. We approach the problem by reducing it to several classical real root counting problems for certain related polynomials.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00866.pdf,"Hoon Hong, Daniel Profili, J.

Variational Inference for Uncertainty Quantification: an Analysis of Trade-offs,"Given an intractable distribution $p$, the problem of variational inference (VI) is to find the best approximation from some more tractable family $Q$. Commonly, one chooses $Q$ to be a family of factorized distributions (i.e., the mean-field assumption), even though~$p$ itself does not factorize. We show that this mismatch leads to an impossibility theorem: if $p$ does not factorize, then any factorized approximation $q\in Q$ can correctly estimate at most one of the following three measures of uncertainty: (i) the marginal variances, (ii) the marginal precisions, or (iii) the generalized variance (which can be related to the entropy). In practice, the best variational approximation in $Q$ is found by minimizing some divergence $D(q,p)$ between distributions, and so we ask: how does the choice of divergence determine which measure of uncertainty, if any, is correctly estimated by VI? We consider the classic Kullback-Leibler divergences, the more general $\alpha$-divergences, and a score-based divergence which compares $\nabla \log p$ and $\nabla \log q$. We provide a thorough theoretical analysis in the setting where $p$ is a Gaussian and $q$ is a (factorized) Gaussian. We show that all the considered divergences can be \textit{ordered} based on the estimates of uncertainty they yield as objective functions for~VI. Finally, we empirically evaluate the validity of this ordering when the target distribution $p$ is not Gaussian.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13748.pdf,"Charles C.

Are Colors Quanta of Light for Human Vision? A Quantum Cognition Study of Visual Perception,"We show that colors are light quanta for human visual perception in a similar way as photons are light quanta for physical measurements of light waves. Our result relies on the identification in the quantum measurement process itself of the warping mechanism which is characteristic of human perception. This warping mechanism makes stimuli classified into the same category perceived as more similar, while stimuli classified into different m categories are perceived as more different. In the quantum measurement process, the warping takes place between the pure states, which play the role played for human perception by the stimuli, and the density states after decoherence, which play the role played for human perception by the percepts. We use the natural metric for pure states, namely the normalized Fubini Study metric to measure distances between pure states, and the natural metric for density states, namely the normalized trace-class metric, to measure distances between density states. We then show that when pure states lie within a well-defined region surrounding an eigenstate, the quantum measurement, namely the process of decoherence, contracts the distance between these pure states, while the reverse happens for pure states lying in a well-defined region between two eigenstates, for which the quantum measurement causes a dilation. We elaborate as an example the situation of a two-dimensional quantum measurement described by the Bloch model and apply it to the situation of two colors 'Light' and 'Dark'. We argue that this analogy of warping, on the one hand in human perception and on the other hand in the quantum measurement process, makes colors to be quanta of light for human vision.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18850.pdf,"Jonito Aerts Argu\""elles",q-bio.NC
Strong Screening Rules for Group-based SLOPE Models,"Tuning the regularization parameter in penalized regression models is an expensive task, requiring multiple models to be fit along a path of parameters.

The developed rules are applicable to the wider family of group-based OWL models, including OSCAR. Our experiments on both synthetic and real data show that the screening rules significantly accelerate the fitting process. The screening rules make it accessible for group SLOPE and sparse-group SLOPE to be applied to high-dimensional datasets, particularly those encountered in genetics.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15357.pdf,"Fabio Feser, Marina Evangelou",stat.ML

radarODE: An ODE-Embedded Deep Learning Model for Contactless ECG Reconstruction from Millimeter-Wave Radar,"Radar-based contactless cardiac monitoring has become a popular research direction recently, but the fine-grained electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is still hard to reconstruct from millimeter-wave radar signal. The key obstacle is to decouple the cardiac activities in the electrical domain (i.e., ECG) from that in the mechanical domain (i.e., heartbeat), and most existing research only uses pure data-driven methods to map such domain transformation as a black box. Therefore, this work first proposes a signal model for domain transformation, and then a novel deep learning framework called radarODE is designed to fuse the temporal and morphological features extracted from radar signals and generate ECG. In addition, ordinary differential equations are embedded in radarODE as a decoder to provide morphological prior, helping the convergence of the model training and improving the robustness under body movements. After being validated on the dataset, the proposed radarODE achieves better performance compared with the benchmark in terms of missed detection rate, root mean square error, Pearson correlation coefficient with the improvement of 9%, 16% and 19%, respectively. The validation results imply that radarODE is capable of recovering ECG signals from radar signals with high fidelity and can be potentially implemented in real-life scenarios.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01672.pdf,"Yuanyuan Zhang, Runwei Guan, Lingxiao Li, Rui Yang, Yutao Yue, Eng Gee Lim",eess.SP
Universal Matrix Multiplication on Quantum Computer,"As a core underlying operation in pattern recognition and machine learning, matrix multiplication plays a crucial role in modern machine learning models and constitutes a major contributor to computational expenditure. Hence, researchers have spent decades continuously searching for more efficient matrix multiplication algorithms.This paper firstly introduces an innovative and practical approach to universal quantum matrix multiplication. We designed optimized quantum adders and multipliers based on Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), which significantly reduced the number of gates used compared to classical adders and multipliers. Subsequently, we construct the basic universal quantum matrix multiplication and extend it to the Strassen algorithm. We conduct comparative experiments to analyze the performance of the quantum matrix multiplication and evaluate the acceleration provided by the optimized quantum adder and multiplier. Finally, we investigate the advantages of the quantum Strassen algorithm and the basic quantum matrix multiplication. Our result opens, for the first time, a reliable pathway for designing universal quantum matrix multiplication. Following this pathway, quantum computing will unlock significantly greater potential for training modern machine learning models.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03085.pdf,"Jiaqi Yao, Tianjian Huang, Ding Liu",quant-ph
Survey of Data-driven Newsvendor: Unified Analysis and Spectrum of Achievable Regrets,"In the Newsvendor problem, the goal is to guess the number that will be drawn from some distribution, with asymmetric consequences for guessing too high vs. too low. In the data-driven version, the distribution is unknown, and one must work with samples from the distribution. Data-driven Newsvendor has been studied under many variants: additive vs. multiplicative regret, high probability vs. expectation bounds, and different distribution classes. This paper studies all combinations of these variants, filling in many gaps in the literature and simplifying many proofs. In particular, we provide a unified analysis based on the notion of clustered distributions, which in conjunction with our new lower bounds, shows that the entire spectrum of regrets between $1/\sqrt{n}$ and $1/n$ can be possible. Simulations on commonly-used distributions demonstrate that our notion is the ""correct"" predictor of empirical regret across varying data sizes.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03505.pdf,"Zhuoxin Chen, Will Ma",stat.ML
Towards Predicting Temporal Changes in a Patient's Chest X-ray Images based on Electronic Health Records,"Chest X-ray (CXR) is an important diagnostic tool widely used in hospitals to assess patient conditions and monitor changes over time. Recently, generative models, specifically diffusion-based models, have shown promise in generating realistic synthetic CXRs. However, these models mainly focus on conditional generation using single-time-point data, i.e., generating CXRs conditioned on their corresponding reports from a specific time. This limits their clinical utility, particularly for capturing temporal changes. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, EHRXDiff, which predicts future CXR images by integrating previous CXRs with subsequent medical events, e.g., prescriptions, lab measures, etc. Our framework dynamically tracks and predicts disease progression based on a latent diffusion model, conditioned on the previous CXR image and a history of medical events. We comprehensively evaluate the performance of our framework across three key aspects, including clinical consistency, demographic consistency, and visual realism. Results show that our framework generates high-quality, realistic future images that effectively capture potential temporal changes. This suggests that our framework could be further developed to support clinical decision-making and provide valuable insights for patient monitoring and treatment planning in the medical field.

"Nonparametric IPSS: Fast, flexible feature selection with false discovery control","Feature selection is a critical task in machine learning and statistics. However, existing feature selection methods either (i) rely on parametric methods such as linear or generalized linear models, (ii) lack theoretical false discovery control, or (iii) identify few true positives. Here, we introduce a general feature selection method with finite-sample false discovery control based on applying integrated path stability selection (IPSS) to arbitrary feature importance scores. The method is nonparametric whenever the importance scores are nonparametric, and it estimates q-values, which are better suited to high-dimensional data than p-values. We focus on two special cases using importance scores from gradient boosting (IPSSGB) and random forests (IPSSRF). Extensive nonlinear simulations with RNA sequencing data show that both methods accurately control the false discovery rate and detect more true positives than existing methods. Both methods are also efficient, running in under 20 seconds when there are 500 samples and 5000 features. We apply IPSSGB and IPSSRF to detect microRNAs and genes related to cancer, finding that they yield better predictions with fewer features than existing approaches.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02208.pdf,"Omar Melikechi, David B.

radarODE-MTL: A Multi-Task Learning Framework with Eccentric Gradient Alignment for Robust Radar-Based ECG Reconstruction,"Millimeter-wave radar is promising to provide robust and accurate vital sign monitoring in an unobtrusive manner. However, the radar signal might be distorted in propagation by ambient noise or random body movement, ruining the subtle cardiac activities and destroying the vital sign recovery. In particular, the recovery of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal heavily relies on the deep-learning model and is sensitive to noise. Therefore, this work creatively deconstructs the radar-based ECG recovery into three individual tasks and proposes a multi-task learning (MTL) framework, radarODE-MTL, to increase the robustness against consistent and abrupt noises. In addition, to alleviate the potential conflicts in optimizing individual tasks, a novel multi-task optimization strategy, eccentric gradient alignment (EGA), is proposed to dynamically trim the task-specific gradients based on task difficulties in orthogonal space. The proposed radarODE-MTL with EGA is evaluated on the public dataset with prominent improvements in accuracy, and the performance remains consistent under noises. The experimental results indicate that radarODE-MTL could reconstruct accurate ECG signals robustly from radar signals and imply the application prospect in real-life situations.

Queueing Matching Bandits with Preference Feedback,"In this study, we consider multi-class multi-server asymmetric queueing systems consisting of $N$ queues on one side and $K$ servers on the other side, where jobs randomly arrive in queues at each time. The service rate of each job-server assignment is unknown and modeled by a feature-based Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) function. At each time, a scheduler assigns jobs to servers, and each server stochastically serves at most one job based on its preferences over the assigned jobs. The primary goal of the algorithm is to stabilize the queues in the system while learning the service rates of servers. To achieve this goal, we propose algorithms based on UCB and Thompson Sampling, which achieve system stability with an average queue length bound of $O(\min\{N,K\}/\epsilon)$ for a large time horizon $T$, where $\epsilon$ is a traffic slackness of the system. Furthermore, the algorithms achieve sublinear regret bounds of $\tilde{O}(\min\{\sqrt{T} Q_{\max},T^{3/4}\})$, where $Q_{\max}$ represents the maximum queue length over agents and times. Lastly, we provide experimental results to demonstrate the performance of our algorithms.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10098.pdf,"Jung-hun Kim, Min-hwan Oh",stat.ML
Model-agnostic basis functions for the 2-point correlation function of dark matter in linear theory,"We consider approximating the linearly evolved 2-point correlation function (2pcf) of dark matter $\xi_{\rm lin}(r;\boldsymbol{\theta})$ in a cosmological model with parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ as the linear combination $\xi_{\rm lin}(r;\boldsymbol{\theta})\approx\sum_i\,b_i(r)\,w_i(\boldsymbol{\theta})$, where the functions $\mathcal{B}=\{b_i(r)\}$ form a $\textit{model-agnostic basis}$ for the linear 2pcf. This decomposition is important for model-agnostic analyses of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the nonlinear 2pcf of galaxies that fix $\mathcal{B}$ and leave the coefficients $\{w_i\}$ free. To date, such analyses have made simple but sub-optimal choices for $\mathcal{B}$, such as monomials. We develop a machine learning framework for systematically discovering a $\textit{minimal}$ basis $\mathcal{B}$ that describes $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ near the BAO feature in a wide class of cosmological models. We use a custom architecture, denoted $\texttt{BiSequential}$, for a neural network (NN) that explicitly realizes the separation between $r$ and $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ above. The optimal NN trained on data in which only $\{\Omega_{\rm m},h\}$ are varied in a $\textit{flat}$ $\Lambda$CDM model produces a basis $\mathcal{B}$ comprising $9$ functions capable of describing $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ to $\sim0.6\%$ accuracy in $\textit{curved}$ $w$CDM models varying 7 parameters within $\sim5\%$ of their fiducial, flat $\Lambda$CDM values. Scales such as the peak, linear point and zero-crossing of $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ are also recovered with very high accuracy. We compare our approach to other compression schemes in the literature, and speculate that $\mathcal{B}$ may also encompass $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ in modified gravity models near our fiducial $\Lambda$CDM model. Using our basis functions in model-agnostic BAO analyses can potentially lead to significant statistical gains.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21374.pdf,"Aseem Paranjape (IUCAA), Ravi K.

MAMMAL -- Molecular Aligned Multi-Modal Architecture and Language,"Large language models applied to vast biological datasets have the potential to transform biology by uncovering disease mechanisms and accelerating drug development. However, current models are often siloed, trained separately on small-molecules, proteins, or transcriptomic data, limiting their ability to capture complex, multi-modal interactions. Effective drug discovery requires computational tools that integrate multiple biological entities while supporting prediction and generation, a challenge existing models struggle to address. For this purpose, we present MAMMAL - Molecular Aligned Multi-Modal Architecture and Language - a versatile method applied to create a multi-task foundation model that learns from large-scale biological datasets across diverse modalities, including proteins, small-molecules, and omics. MAMMAL's structured prompt syntax supports classification, regression, and generation tasks while handling token and scalar inputs and outputs. Evaluated on eleven diverse downstream tasks, it reaches a new state of the art (SOTA) in nine tasks and is comparable to SOTA in two tasks, all within a unified architecture, unlike prior task-specific models. Additionally, we explored Alphafold 3 binding prediction capabilities on antibody-antigen and nanobody-antigen complexes showing significantly better classification performance of MAMMAL in 3 out of 4 targets.

Quantum computing inspired paintings: reinterpreting classical masterpieces,"We aim to apply a quantum computing technique to compose artworks. The main idea is to revisit three paintings of different styles and historical periods: ''Narciso'', painted circa 1597-1599 by Michelangelo Merisi (Caravaggio), ''Les fils de l'homme'', painted in 1964 by Rene Magritte and ''192 Farben'', painted in 1966 by Gerard Richter. We utilize the output of a quantum computation to change the composition in the paintings, leading to a paintings series titled ''Quantum Transformation I, II, III''. In particular, the figures are discretized into square lattices and the order of the pieces is changed according to the result of the quantum simulation. We consider an Ising Hamiltonian as the observable in the quantum computation and its time evolution as the final outcome. From a classical subject to abstract forms, we seek to combine classical and quantum aesthetics through these three art pieces.

Modular Autonomous Virtualization System for Two-Dimensional Semiconductor Quantum Dot Arrays,"Arrays of gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots are among the leading candidates for building scalable quantum processors. High-fidelity initialization, control, and readout of spin qubit registers require exquisite and targeted control over key Hamiltonian parameters that define the electrostatic environment. However, due to the tight gate pitch, capacitive crosstalk between gates hinders independent tuning of chemical potentials and interdot couplings. While virtual gates offer a practical solution, determining all the required cross-capacitance matrices accurately and efficiently in large quantum dot registers is an open challenge. Here, we establish a modular automated virtualization system (MAViS) -- a general and modular framework for autonomously constructing a complete stack of multilayer virtual gates in real time. Our method employs machine learning techniques to rapidly extract features from two-dimensional charge stability diagrams. We then utilize computer vision and regression models to self-consistently determine all relative capacitive couplings necessary for virtualizing plunger and barrier gates in both low- and high-tunnel-coupling regimes. Using MAViS, we successfully demonstrate accurate virtualization of a dense two-dimensional array comprising ten quantum dots defined in a high-quality Ge/SiGe heterostructure. Our work offers an elegant and practical solution for the efficient control of large-scale semiconductor quantum dot systems.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12516.pdf,"Anantha S.

OSMamba: Omnidirectional Spectral Mamba with Dual-Domain Prior Generator for Exposure Correction,"Exposure correction is a fundamental problem in computer vision and image processing. Recently, frequency domain-based methods have achieved impressive improvement, yet they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios under extreme exposure conditions. This is due to the local convolutional receptive fields failing to model long-range dependencies in the spectrum, and the non-generative learning paradigm being inadequate for retrieving lost details from severely degraded regions. In this paper, we propose Omnidirectional Spectral Mamba (OSMamba), a novel exposure correction network that incorporates the advantages of state space models and generative diffusion models to address these limitations. Specifically, OSMamba introduces an omnidirectional spectral scanning mechanism that adapts Mamba to the frequency domain to capture comprehensive long-range dependencies in both the amplitude and phase spectra of deep image features, hence enhancing illumination correction and structure recovery. Furthermore, we develop a dual-domain prior generator that learns from well-exposed images to generate a degradation-free diffusion prior containing correct information about severely under- and over-exposed regions for better detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple-exposure and mixed-exposure datasets demonstrate that the proposed OSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15255.pdf,"Gehui Li, Bin Chen, Chen Zhao, Lei Zhang, Jian Zhang",eess.IV
FedSynthCT-Brain: A Federated Learning Framework for Multi-Institutional Brain MRI-to-CT Synthesis,"The generation of Synthetic Computed Tomography (sCT) images has become a pivotal methodology in modern clinical practice, particularly in the context of Radiotherapy (RT) treatment planning. The use of sCT enables the calculation of doses, pushing towards Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) guided radiotherapy treatments. Deep learning methods for MRI-to-sCT have shown promising results, but their reliance on single-centre training dataset limits generalisation capabilities to diverse clinical settings. Moreover, creating centralised multi-centre datasets may pose privacy concerns. To address the aforementioned issues, we introduced FedSynthCT-Brain, an approach based on the Federated Learning (FL) paradigm for MRI-to-sCT in brain imaging. This is among the first applications of FL for MRI-to-sCT, employing a cross-silo horizontal FL approach that allows multiple centres to collaboratively train a U-Net-based deep learning model. We validated our method using real multicentre data from four European and American centres, simulating heterogeneous scanner types and acquisition modalities, and tested its performance on an independent dataset from a centre outside the federation. In the case of the unseen centre, the federated model achieved a median Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of $102.0$ HU across 23 patients, with an interquartile range of $96.7-110.5$ HU. The median (interquartile range) for the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PNSR) were $0.89 (0.86-0.89)$ and $26.58 (25.52-27.42)$, respectively. The analysis of the results showed acceptable performances of the federated approach, thus highlighting the potential of FL to enhance MRI-to-sCT to improve generalisability and advancing safe and equitable clinical applications while fostering collaboration and preserving data privacy.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06690.pdf,"Ciro Benito Raggio, Mathias Krohmer Zabaleta, Nils Skupien, Oliver Blanck, Francesco Cicone, Giuseppe Lucio Cascini, Paolo Zaffino, Lucia Migliorelli, Maria Francesca Spadea",eess.IV
On the metric mean dimensions of saturated sets,"Saturated sets and its reduced case, the set of generic points, constitute two significant types of fractal-like sets in multifractal analysis of dynamical systems.

"Lilan: A linear latent network approach for real-time solutions of stiff, nonlinear, ordinary differential equations","Solving stiff ordinary differential equations (StODEs) requires sophisticated numerical solvers, which are often computationally expensive. In particular, StODE's often cannot be solved with traditional explicit time integration schemes and one must resort to costly implicit methods to compute solutions. On the other hand, state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) based methods such as Neural ODE (NODE) poorly handle the timescale separation of various elements of the solutions to StODEs and require expensive implicit solvers for integration at inference time. In this work, we embark on a different path which involves learning a latent dynamics for StODEs, in which one completely avoids numerical integration. To that end, we consider a constant velocity latent dynamical system whose solution is a sequence of straight lines. Given the initial condition and parameters of the ODE, the encoder networks learn the slope (i.e the constant velocity) and the initial condition for the latent dynamics. In other words, the solution of the original dynamics is encoded into a sequence of straight lines which can be decoded back to retrieve the actual solution as and when required. Another key idea in our approach is a nonlinear transformation of time, which allows for the ""stretching/squeezing"" of time in the latent space, thereby allowing for varying levels of attention to different temporal regions in the solution. Additionally, we provide a simple universal-approximation-type proof showing that our approach can approximate the solution of stiff nonlinear system on a compact set to any degree of accuracy, {\epsilon}. We show that the dimension of the latent dynamical system in our approach is independent of {\epsilon}. Numerical investigation on prototype StODEs suggest that our method outperforms state-of-the art machine learning approaches for handling StODEs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08423.pdf,"William Cole Nockolds, C.

On winding numbers of almost embeddings of $K_4$ in the plane,Let $K_4$ be the complete graph on four vertices. Let $f$ be a continuous map of $K_4$ to the plane such that $f$-images of non-adjacent edges are disjoint. For any vertex $v \in K_4$ take the winding number of the $f$-image of the cycle $K_4 - v$ around $f(v)$. It is known that the sum of these four integers is odd. We construct examples showing that this is the only relation between these four numbers.,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15642.pdf,"Emil Alkin, Alexander Miroshnikov",math.GT
Optimal Transport-based Conformal Prediction,"Conformal Prediction (CP) is a principled framework for quantifying uncertainty in blackbox learning models, by constructing prediction sets with finite-sample coverage guarantees. Traditional approaches rely on scalar nonconformity scores, which fail to fully exploit the geometric structure of multivariate outputs, such as in multi-output regression or multiclass classification. Recent methods addressing this limitation impose predefined convex shapes for the prediction sets, potentially misaligning with the intrinsic data geometry. We introduce a novel CP procedure handling multivariate score functions through the lens of optimal transport. Specifically, we leverage Monge-Kantorovich vector ranks and quantiles to construct prediction region with flexible, potentially non-convex shapes, better suited to the complex uncertainty patterns encountered in multivariate learning tasks. We prove that our approach ensures finite-sample, distribution-free coverage properties, similar to typical CP methods. We then adapt our method for multi-output regression and multiclass classification, and also propose simple adjustments to generate adaptive prediction regions with asymptotic conditional coverage guarantees. Finally, we evaluate our method on practical regression and classification problems, illustrating its advantages in terms of (conditional) coverage and efficiency.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18991.pdf,"Gauthier Thurin (CNRS), Kimia Nadjahi (CNRS), Claire Boyer (LMO)",stat.ML
Deep Neural Network for Phonon-Assisted Optical Spectra in Semiconductors,"Ab initio based accurate simulation of phonon-assisted optical spectra of semiconductors at finite temperatures remains a formidable challenge, as it requires large supercells for phonon sampling and computationally expensive high-accuracy exchange-correlation (XC) functionals. In this work, we present an efficient approach that combines deep learning tight-binding and potential models to address this challenge with ab initio fidelity. By leveraging molecular dynamics for atomic configuration sampling and deep learning-enabled rapid Hamiltonian evaluation, our approach enables large-scale simulations of temperature-dependent optical properties using advanced XC functionals (HSE, SCAN). Demonstrated on silicon and gallium arsenide across temperature 100-400 K, the method accurately captures phonon-induced bandgap renormalization and indirect/direct absorption processes which are in excellent agreement with experimental findings over five orders of magnitude. This work establishes a pathway for high-throughput investigation of electron-phonon coupled phenomena in complex materials, overcoming traditional computational limitations arising from large supercell used with computationally expensive XC-functionals.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00798.pdf,"Qiangqiang Gu, Shishir Kumar Pandey, Zhanghao Zhouyin",cond-mat.mtrl-sci
Taking a Big Step: Large Learning Rates in Denoising Score Matching Prevent Memorization,"Denoising score matching plays a pivotal role in the performance of diffusion-based generative models. However, the empirical optimal score--the exact solution to the denoising score matching--leads to memorization, where generated samples replicate the training data. Yet, in practice, only a moderate degree of memorization is observed, even without explicit regularization. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon by uncovering an implicit regularization mechanism driven by large learning rates. Specifically, we show that in the small-noise regime, the empirical optimal score exhibits high irregularity. We then prove that, when trained by stochastic gradient descent with a large enough learning rate, neural networks cannot stably converge to a local minimum with arbitrarily small excess risk. Consequently, the learned score cannot be arbitrarily close to the empirical optimal score, thereby mitigating memorization. To make the analysis tractable, we consider one-dimensional data and two-layer neural networks. Experiments validate the crucial role of the learning rate in preventing memorization, even beyond the one-dimensional setting.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03435.pdf,"Yu-Han Wu, Pierre Marion, G\'erard Biau, Claire Boyer",stat.ML
Transfer Learning of CATE with Kernel Ridge Regression,"The proliferation of data has sparked significant interest in leveraging findings from one study to estimate treatment effects in a different target population without direct outcome observations. However, the transfer learning process is frequently hindered by substantial covariate shift and limited overlap between (i) the source and target populations, as well as (ii) the treatment and control groups within the source. We propose a novel method for overlap-adaptive transfer learning of conditional average treatment effect (CATE) using kernel ridge regression (KRR). Our approach involves partitioning the labeled source data into two subsets. The first one is used to train candidate CATE models based on regression adjustment and pseudo-outcomes. An optimal model is then selected using the second subset and unlabeled target data, employing another pseudo-outcome-based strategy. We provide a theoretical justification for our method through sharp non-asymptotic MSE bounds, highlighting its adaptivity to both weak overlaps and the complexity of CATE function. Extensive numerical studies confirm that our method achieves superior finite-sample efficiency and adaptability. We conclude by demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach using a 401(k) eligibility dataset.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11331.pdf,"Seok-Jin Kim, Hongjie Liu, Molei Liu, Kaizheng Wang",stat.ME
Liver Cirrhosis Stage Estimation from MRI with Deep Learning,"We present an end-to-end deep learning framework for automated liver cirrhosis stage estimation from multi-sequence MRI. Cirrhosis is the severe scarring (fibrosis) of the liver and a common endpoint of various chronic liver diseases. Early diagnosis is vital to prevent complications such as decompensation and cancer, which significantly decreases life expectancy. However, diagnosing cirrhosis in its early stages is challenging, and patients often present with life-threatening complications. Our approach integrates multi-scale feature learning with sequence-specific attention mechanisms to capture subtle tissue variations across cirrhosis progression stages. Using CirrMRI600+, a large-scale publicly available dataset of 628 high-resolution MRI scans from 339 patients, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in three-stage cirrhosis classification. Our best model achieves 72.8% accuracy on T1W and 63.8% on T2W sequences, significantly outperforming traditional radiomics-based approaches. Through extensive ablation studies, we show that our architecture effectively learns stage-specific imaging biomarkers. We establish new benchmarks for automated cirrhosis staging and provide insights for developing clinically applicable deep learning systems.

Weighted balanced truncation method for approximating kernel functions by exponentials,"Kernel approximation with exponentials is useful in many problems with convolution quadrature and particle interactions such as integral-differential equations, molecular dynamics and machine learning. This paper proposes a weighted balanced truncation to construct an optimal model reduction method for compressing the number of exponentials in the sum-of-exponentials approximation of kernel functions. This method shows great promise in approximating long-range kernels, achieving over 4 digits of accuracy improvement for the Ewald-splitting and inverse power kernels in comparison with the classical balanced truncation.

E-Values Expand the Scope of Conformal Prediction,"Conformal prediction is a powerful framework for distribution-free uncertainty quantification. The standard approach to conformal prediction relies on comparing the ranks of prediction scores: under exchangeability, the rank of a future test point cannot be too extreme relative to a calibration set. This rank-based method can be reformulated in terms of p-values. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach based on e-values, known as conformal e-prediction. E-values offer key advantages that cannot be achieved with p-values, enabling new theoretical and practical capabilities. In particular, we present three applications that leverage the unique strengths of e-values: batch anytime-valid conformal prediction, fixed-size conformal sets with data-dependent coverage, and conformal prediction under ambiguous ground truth. Overall, these examples demonstrate that e-value-based constructions provide a flexible expansion of the toolbox of conformal prediction.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13050.pdf,"Etienne Gauthier, Francis Bach, Michael I.

Heart Failure Prediction using Modal Decomposition and Masked Autoencoders for Scarce Echocardiography Databases,"Heart diseases constitute the main cause of international human defunction. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 18 million deaths happen each year due to precisely heart diseases. In particular, heart failures (HF) press the healthcare industry to develop systems for their early, rapid, and effective prediction. This work presents an automatic system based on a novel deep learning framework which analyses in real-time echocardiography video sequences for the challenging and more specific task of heart failure time prediction. This system works in two stages. The first one transforms the data from a database of echocardiography video sequences into a machine learning-compatible collection of annotated images which can be used in the training phase of any machine learning-based framework, including a deep learning-based one. This stage includes the use of the Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) algorithm for both data augmentation and feature extraction. The second stage builds and trains a Vision Transformer (ViT). Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, so far barely explored in the literature about heart failure prediction, are adopted to effectively train the ViT from scratch, even with scarce databases. The designed neural network analyses images from echocardiography sequences to estimate the time in which a heart failure will happen. The results obtained show the efficacy of the HODMD algorithm and the superiority of the proposed system with respect to several established ViT and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. The source code will be incorporated into the next version release of the ModelFLOWs-app software (https://github.com/modelflows/ModelFLOWs-app).",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07606.pdf,"Andr\'es Bell-Navas, Mar\'ia Villalba-Orero, Enrique Lara-Pezzi, Jes\'us Garicano-Mena, Soledad Le Clainche",eess.IV
Bayesian Rao test for distributed target detection in interference and noise with limited training data,"This paper has studied the problem of detecting a range-spread target in interference and noise when the number of training data is limited. The interference is located within a certain subspace with an unknown coordinate, while the noise follows a Gaussian distribution with an unknown covariance matrix. We concentrate on the scenarios where the training data are limited and employ a Bayesian framework to ffnd a solution. Speciffcally, the covariance matrix is assumed to follow an inverse Wishart distribution. Then, we introduce the Bayesian detector according to the Rao test, which, demonstrated by both simulation experiment and real data, has superior detection performance to the existing detectors in certain situations.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13235.pdf,"Daipeng Xiao, Weijian Liu, Jun Liu, Yuntao Wu, Qinglei Du, Xiaoqiang Hua",stat.ME
PINN-MEP: Continuous Neural Representations for Minimum-Energy Path Discovery in Molecular Systems,"Characterizing conformational transitions in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge in the computational sciences. Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16381.pdf,"Magnus Petersen, Roberto Covino",physics.chem-ph
Two-parameter superposable S-curves,"Straight line equation $y=mx$ with slope $m$, when singularly perturbed as $ay^3+y=mx$ with a positive parameter $a$, results in S-shaped curves or S-curves on a real plane. As $a\rightarrow 0$, we get back $y=mx$ which is a cumulative distribution function of a continuous uniform distribution that describes the occurrence of every event in an interval to be equally probable. As $a\rightarrow\infty$, the derivative of $y$ has finite support only at $y=0$ resembling a degenerate distribution. Based on these arguments, in this work, we propose that these S-curves can represent maximum entropy uniform distribution to a zero entropy single value. We also argue that these S-curves are superposable as they are only parametrically nonlinear but fundamentally linear. So far, the superposed forms have been used to capture the patterns of natural systems such as nonlinear dynamics of biological growth and kinetics of enzyme reactions. Here, we attempt to use the S-curve and its superposed form as statistical models. We fit the models on a classical dataset containing flower measurements of iris plants and analyze their usefulness in pattern recognition. Based on these models, we claim that any non-uniform pattern can be represented as a singular perturbation to uniform distribution. However, our parametric estimation procedure have some limitations such as sensitivity to initial conditions depending on the data at hand.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19488.pdf,Vijay Prakash S,stat.ME

Light Weight CNN for classification of Brain Tumors from MRI Images,"This study presents a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach for the multi-class classification of brain tumors using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We utilize a publicly available dataset containing MRI images categorized into four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. Our primary objective is to build a light weight deep learning model that can automatically classify brain tumor types with high accuracy. To achieve this goal, we incorporate image preprocessing steps, including normalization, data augmentation, and a cropping technique designed to reduce background noise and emphasize relevant regions. The CNN architecture is optimized through hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner, enabling systematic exploration of network parameters. To ensure reliable evaluation, we apply 5-fold cross-validation, where each hyperparameter configuration is evaluated across multiple data splits to mitigate overfitting. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a classification accuracy of 98.78%, indicating its potential as a diagnostic aid in clinical settings. The proposed method offers a low-complexity yet effective solution for assisting in early brain tumor diagnosis.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21188.pdf,Natnael Alemayehu,eess.IV
Adversarial Robustness of Deep Learning Models for Inland Water Body Segmentation from SAR Images,"Inland water body segmentation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is an important task needed for several applications, such as flood mapping. While SAR sensors capture data in all-weather conditions as high-resolution images, differentiating water and water-like surfaces from SAR images is not straightforward. Inland water bodies, such as large river basins, have complex geometry, which adds to the challenge of segmentation. U-Net is a widely used deep learning model for land-water segmentation of SAR images. In practice, manual annotation is often used to generate the corresponding water masks as ground truth. Manual annotation of the images is prone to label noise owing to data poisoning attacks, especially due to complex geometry. In this work, we simulate manual errors in the form of adversarial attacks on the U-Net model and study the robustness of the model to human errors in annotation. Our results indicate that U-Net can tolerate a certain level of corruption before its performance drops significantly. This finding highlights the crucial role that the quality of manual annotations plays in determining the effectiveness of the segmentation model. The code and the new dataset, along with adversarial examples for robust training, are publicly available.

Regression is all you need for medical image translation,"The acquisition of information-rich images within a limited time budget is crucial in medical imaging. Medical image translation (MIT) can help enhance and supplement existing datasets by generating synthetic images from acquired data. While Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural image generation, their benefits - creativity and image realism - do not necessarily transfer to medical applications where highly accurate anatomical information is required. In fact, the imitation of acquisition noise or content hallucination hinder clinical utility. Here, we introduce YODA (You Only Denoise once - or Average), a novel 2.5D diffusion-based framework for volumetric MIT. YODA unites diffusion and regression paradigms to produce realistic or noise-free outputs. Furthermore, we propose Expectation-Approximation (ExpA) DM sampling, which draws inspiration from MRI signal averaging. ExpA-sampling suppresses generated noise and, thus, eliminates noise from biasing the evaluation of image quality. Through extensive experiments on four diverse multi-modal datasets - comprising multi-contrast brain MRI and pelvic MRI-CT - we show that diffusion and regression sampling yield similar results in practice. As such, the computational overhead of diffusion sampling does not provide systematic benefits in medical information translation. Building on these insights, we demonstrate that YODA outperforms several state-of-the-art GAN and DM methods. Notably, YODA-generated images are shown to be interchangeable with, or even superior to, physical acquisitions for several downstream tasks. Our findings challenge the presumed advantages of DMs in MIT and pave the way for the practical application of MIT in medical imaging.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02048.pdf,"Sebastian Rassmann, David K\""ugler, Christian Ewert, Martin Reuter",eess.IV
Resolving Memorization in Empirical Diffusion Model for Manifold Data in High-Dimensional Spaces,"Diffusion models is a popular computational tool to generate new data samples. It utilizes a forward diffusion process that add noise to the data distribution and then use a reverse process to remove noises to produce samples from the data distribution. However, when the empirical data distribution consists of $n$ data point, using the empirical diffusion model will necessarily produce one of the existing data points. This is often referred to as the memorization effect, which is usually resolved by sophisticated machine learning procedures in the current literature. This work shows that the memorization problem can be resolved by a simple inertia update step at the end of the empirical diffusion model simulation. Our inertial diffusion model requires only the empirical diffusion model score function and it does not require any further training. We show that choosing the inertia diffusion model sample distribution is an $O\left(n^{-\frac{2}{d+4}}\right)$ Wasserstein-1 approximation of a data distribution lying on a $C^2$ manifold of dimension $d$. Since this estimate is significant smaller the Wasserstein1 distance between population and empirical distributions, it rigorously shows the inertial diffusion model produces new data samples. Remarkably, this upper bound is completely free of the ambient space dimension, since there is no training involved. Our analysis utilizes the fact that the inertial diffusion model samples are approximately distributed as the Gaussian kernel density estimator on the manifold. This reveals an interesting connection between diffusion model and manifold learning.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02508.pdf,"Yang Lyu, Yuchun Qian, Tan Minh Nguyen, Xin T. Tong",stat.ML
